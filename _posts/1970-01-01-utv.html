<p>This was a project done under <a href="http://www.missioniq.com">MissionIQ</a>.
<p>For a period of seven months <a href="http://www.utvinternet.com">utvinternet</a>
I was a core member of three who ensured that the processes in the organisation ran
smoothly while the organisation was going through a buy out process.</p>
<p>Their systems were quite large and written in a mixture of VBScript, .net and c#.</p>
<p>As well maintaining the integrity of the systems we were also tasked with porting
the systems over to be compitable with the <a href="http://www.ebillz.com/">ebillz</a> 
platform.</p>
