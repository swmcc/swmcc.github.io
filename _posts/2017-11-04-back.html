<p>So I am back blogging again. I am not going to make a big deal out of it, I am not going to promote it. I will just simply aim to blog at least once a week and add content here and see what happens.</pa>
<p>I haven't blogged in almost two years. Since that time I've started a new job and learnt lots. My job/career has moved on and I really think after almost eighteen years I am in a happy place and finally know what I am doing, or at least know what I should be doing.</p>
<p>I will try and keep the cadence of these posts up to once a week, sometimes there might be more but lets hope there is never less. Most of them will be technology focused if not all of them.</p>
<p>Lets see what happens......</p>
