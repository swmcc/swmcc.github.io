HO HUM... Not much to say apart from I really must start to sort this site out soon. I was out with Shane on Friday night for a few pints and I lost (or some little shit stole) my mobile :( I went home in a drunken state and got the number barred. So I am without a mobile now, which isn't all together that bad (touch wood). I will be getting one tomorrow, if you have a sudden urge to contact me do it through my home number (you can see it at my c.v page). 
Right must go and kick something :)
