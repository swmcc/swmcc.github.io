Well, I took Friday off. I wanted to give myself a break before heading back. I usually like to train in the late afternoon or first thing in the morning (depending on the day). However due to prior commitments I only had time between 10am and 12am, so I headed in at 10:45 to train for an hour.<br /><br />I managed to do more than I did on Thursday, but I only spent 45mins training - I could have went for another 15mins, but since I intend to go tomorrow I thought 45mins was good enough. The leg still isn't 100% yet, so I am happy enough, sortta ;)<br /><br />5 min warm up on the cross trainer - manual - level 8 up to 14<br />Machine weights<br />10 mins on the treadmill - incline 1.5 - speed 8 up to 9.5<br />Free weights working on balance<br />15 mins on the cross trainer - hill - on reverse mode every 2 mins - level 8 up to 15<br />Stretch.<br /><br />I am still way off what I want to be able to do, but I felt a big improvment compared to Thursday.<br />I am going to head to the golf course in the next hour or two and will maybe get 5 holes in or just try go the practise area. The problem with dropping this weight is that its very hard to keep a constant swing. I'll head for a two mile walk tonight as well.<br /><br />It is nice to get back again, I find the gym a huge release for tension and day to day stress. And losing it for two weeks was horrible. I honestly never thought I would miss it as much as I have. And I never thought it would have upset me as much to be as far back as I am.<br /><br />On the good news front though I dropped a pound since Thursday. I still have the nasty feeling that I will put it back on again. I hope I don't, and to be honest it wont annoy me that much if I do - its just a feeling I have.
