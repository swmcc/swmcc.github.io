I've been quiet lately. Not due to lack of motivation or anything. I have been trying a new training regime and just wanted to wait a while before I commented on it.<br /><br />Thanks to the kind words of <a href="http://tracyrif.blogspot.com/">Tracy</a> I decided to change my training schedule this month. I needed a change anyway.<br /><br />Since the start of January I have lost over 5stone (73lb to be exact as of last night). I now tip the scales at below 16stone 11lb. It was the nicest feeling I ever had in a long time seeing 16stone on a weight machine (238lb). However due to this weight loss I have become rather weak. Now I am lifting heavier weights for sure, but as a 28 year old man I should be lifting heavier and faster than I currently am.<br /><br />Now that I am starting to get near my goal of 14stone (200lb) I need to start to think of what happens when I stop losing weight. I have to lose another 3stone, which is 42lb. I am not sure about a time frame for that. I need to discuss that with the PT on Sunday. All I know is that doing a lot of cardio is good, but I have been doing it for so long now that it is getting boring. I also want to get stronger than I currently am.<br /><br />Tracy has done an amazing job in motivating me to try new things. My gym doesn't do kettle bells though :( And boy they cost a fortune too. But I told my PT that I wanted to change my training structure a bit and we agreed that I should see her twice a week now. Once on a Monday early morning and then again on a Thursday late afternoon. I've been doing that for two weeks now and I can already feel the benefits.<br /><br />The thing that I find most interesting is that she isn't getting me to do weights so much, more press-ups (all different ones), mat work, using a medicine ball, stability ball, weighted balls and cable work. I do a good bit of free weights, but most of the work is done in the studio with no weights at all. And you know what, it is fucking working!!! :)<br /><br />So thanks very much to Tracy, who made me get off my butt and try something new.<br /><br />My current schedule looks like this:<br /><br />Monday morning (7am - PT Session)<br />Tuesday afternoon (at the minute it is a 4 mile run)<br />Wednesday morning (7am spin class - pm a walk to stretch out the legs)<br />Thursday afternoon (PT Session)<br />Friday afternoon (5mile run)<br />Saturday off<br />Sunday afternoon (Spin class followed by some cardio in the gym).<br /><br />I am only doing the twice weekly thing for this month. I'll do my own thing again next month. I am still on for doing the 10k (6 mile) run at the start of September with the half marathon in Dublin in the middle of September.<br /><br />Happy Happy Joy Joy
