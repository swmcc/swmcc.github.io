Well my session today with the PT wasn't half bad. Quite enjoyable really. I put on 4grams since last week, but considering I was 1kg over on Monday I am quite happy with it. However I want to be down for next week. I don't think she'll be too happy if I am at the same level too. I wont have a cheat day this month again I think - I know I can do it.<br /><br />I love doing new things, it is a good barometer of how far I have come and today I done lots of new thangs :) First off I went into the Kyzer Gym!!!! I never venture in there, that's where the alpha males go and I am by no means an alpha male :) Anyway after the warmup we went into the Kyzer Gym. I done a good bit of free weights. After that I done a quick run on the treadmill and after that I done squats on the machine upstairs - first time I have ever done that. Then into the studio to do some mat work and boxing on the pads, then a go on the stairmaster and a warm down on the cross trainer. I didn't sweat as much as I usually do and wasn't as tired as I usually am.<br /><br />30kg * 15reps * 3 sets shoulder press<br />20kg * 12reps  * 3 sets front shoulder press<br />15kg each * 10 reps * 3 sets bicep curl<br />15 * 3 sets of bench dips<br />10mins on the treadmill - no incline speed 8.7 - found this very easy.<br />15 * 3 (Can't remember the weight) on the squat machine.<br />5mins on the stair master - 4mins at level 8 - 1min at level 12 - found this easy.<br />20mins mat work including boxing on the pads.<br />5mins on the cross trainer.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the session. I am also running the Lisburn 6k on June the 20th! :) I just registered for it there now. Oh boy - that is gonna be fun. However a good challenge, I like challenges.. Here that Irvine - 6k run biatch - beat that :) ha :)<br /><br />Seriously though, this week has been good. I done several new things and it has made me feel quite good about meself :)
