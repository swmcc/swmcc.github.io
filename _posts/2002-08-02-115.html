<h3>Moveable Type</h3>
<br /><p>Well I now have MT. I will shove up the URL when I get the template working sometime this weekend, and import all my current enteries.</p>
<br /><p>It also seems that <a href="http://www.deeden.co.uk/blog/">Steve</a> listens to me :) Yay!!!! He was also talking about tea... mmmm tea....
<br />So I went and made us all some, now he has this new fangled device that keeps his tea warm cos he usually forgets that he has it and therefore it goes cold. So this new device of his keeps his tea warm, yes it is a flask. But this flask has a picture of an Apple Base Station, so it must be new fangled :)</p>Anyway I like drinking my tea when it is cool, however it usually means I have to drink the tea all at once because the time between SWM tea and cold undrinkable tea is about 1min. I need a new fangled contraption that will keep my tea at a certain temp once it reaches that temp.</p>
<br /><p>MMmm I wonder if Steve's base station cup will allow me to do that.. after all it has an Applce Base Station on it :)</p>
