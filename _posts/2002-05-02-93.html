<h3>Work &amp; Star Wars</h3>
<br />
<br /><p>I suppose I should be working instead of posting this up.. but hey.. sue me :).. Well I have been back at BlackStar a week now and have to say I quite like it. Nice people, good craic and a job that I like, wonderful :)</p>
<br />
<br /><p><a>Star Wars II</a> is out in two weeks time... <b>Come On</b>. Well I have to say that I am not looking that forward to it since Episode I stunk of shite. Anyway LOTR: The Two Towers is out and I am looking forward to that.. Helms Deep, Isengard and the Ents. Oooohhh yes.. But still Star Wars Episode 2 (I will not and do not refer to it as ATOC as it is one shite title) will not dissapoint - will it George?</p>
