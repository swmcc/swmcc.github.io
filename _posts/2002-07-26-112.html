<h3>And another thing...</h3>
<br /><p>When I am coding, I tend to think of my code as characters in a film or story that I know. And as I am on a West Wing kick of late I tend to think about that when I am coding. So today I was writing tests and in my own weird way I got it into my head that some of the code was Toby Zigler interacting with several other characters in the film. Then it dawned on me, in the first Season Toby's wife was a congresswoman, in the second she is the campaign manager or cheif of staff to a Senator that kicked Bartlet in the teeth. Grrrrrrr.  Now, how can a congresswoman move to a 'Chief of Staff' position so quickly? I hope I got this wrong..</p>
