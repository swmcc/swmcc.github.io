My legs haven't been that sore since the run, they have been a bit tight but nothing like I imagined they were gonna be like. The PT was put back a day for various reasons. I was under the impression that my legs would be left alone and that I would be doing a series of weights. This impression was of my own making, as it was never discussed before hand.<br /><br />I done the usual 5min warm up thang on the cross trainer, then a circuit of four weights - chest press (free weights), lateral raises (free weights), seated dips and press-ups. Then after that I done sprints on the cycling machine!! Boy that hurt, two minutes at a low level - 7/8 then for one minute the level was up to 14/15 and had to keep a speed of no less than 111!! That was for a total of 10mins. After that step ups with weights on my arm, weighted lunges - then just for the craic running up the stairs with afore mentioned weights!!! Once that torture was done I had to go on the cross trainer for 10mins at level 14 and keep a speed of 10, which usually wouldn't be a problem but my legs were on fire!!<br /><br />After that I done a series of mat exercises that also killed me, but I had to keep my legs raised the whole time!!<br /><br />It was a very intense PT session, and one that I would not like to repeat anytime soon. I did enjoy it though, but I know my legs are going to be killing me come the weekend.
