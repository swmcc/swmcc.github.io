It wasn't a bad session. I left it until late afternoon at around 5.30pm I only done 45mins again. I think I could have done more, but I didn't want over do it.<br /><br />5mins warm-up on the cross trainer level 8 - 13<br />15 * 3 @ 20kg incline press<br />15 * 3 @ 42kg bench press<br />15 * 3 @ 42kg pectoral fly<br />20 * 3 @ 52kg tricep<br />10mins at various levels - incline 1 - 3 speed 8 - 11<br />5mins on the stairmaster level 4-8<br />5mins on the bike level 8 - 13<br /><br />I really could have done more, maybe a go on the crosstrainer, or 15mins on the bike on random or hill. I decided to take it easy and just conserve my energy instead.<br /><br />I done a two mile walk at night to losen myself up a bit, steady pace. Nothing fancy.<br /><br />I am feeling better about the leg, and think that maybe tomorrow I can give it a full hour and really push myself.
