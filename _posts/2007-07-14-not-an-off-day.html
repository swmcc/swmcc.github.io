Due to Thursday being a public holiday I had to take that as my 'off day' which has screwed with my anal routine, but sure.. Add that to the horrible spin class I had yesterday and you have a rather grumpy Stevie.<br /><br />A quick warm-up on the cross trainer, then a load of weights then a quick run on the treadmill and then some more weights. Nothing to hectic, heading in tomorrow as well, going to do a bit more on the cardio side with some free weights mixed in. I have a friend talked into doing some free weights with me on Monday night and I think the PT found me a running buddy to start to train with this week so it isn't always going to be solitary thing it has been for the past 6 months.<br /><br />5 minutes on the cross trainer @ level 9 - 1.3km<br />15 * 3 @ 56kg chest press<br />15 * 3 @ 56kg lateral pull down (wide grip)<br />15 * 3 @ 40kg over head tricep extension (pully machine)<br />15 * 3 @ 40kg butterfly machine<br />15 * 3 pressups<br />10mins on the treadmill<br /><ul><li>5 mins at level 9 incline 1.5</li><li>1 min at level 9.5 incline 2</li><li>1 min at level 13 no incline</li><li>2 mins at level 10.5 incline 1.5</li><li>1 min at level 10.5 incline 2</li></ul>15 * 3 @ 16kg each incline chest press on the pulley machine<br />15 * 3 @ 25kg seated chest press free weight.<br /><br />I also didn't weigh myself.. :) Its driving me nuts now though.. I need to know that number.. and how come I wont know it until Monday morning.. That's a full 36hours away!!<br /><br />Right.. gonna see Harry Potter now :)
