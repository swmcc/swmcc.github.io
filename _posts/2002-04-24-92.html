<h3>Shopping</h3>
<br /><p>Went shopping today, I bought the new Elton John ablum, not bad will know better when I get play a couple of more times. I think I will post up c.d reviews as well on my <a href="http://swmcc.com" target="_new">webshite</a>.</p>
<br /><p>I also went to Tescos in Conswater, it was at 6:05pm so it wasn't that busy, I got several things and then went to the express checkout, there was no-one there and the place was empty. I went over the cashier, who looked really really really bored and put my stuff down. Now I used to work in a shop and therefore am extremely nice to other shop assistans, I worked as one for 6 years so I know the craic. I wasn't nasty or nice, I said "Hi" when I put the grocies down. He then said "Sorry there are 7 items there, you will have to take them to another checkout". Now this would have been fine if the place was busy, or there was someone behind me but there wasn't a sinner. No-one. So I jokingly said "Come on there are only two extra and the rest of the checkouts have trolleys at them". He then stated again as if he was a fucking robot "Sorry, there are only 5 items allowed to go through at any one time". So me being the nice fella said "Fine, then take 5 items, and I will give you the money and then you can take the other two seperatly". I thought this was reasonable enough. "No, Sorry only 5 items per customer". Now I really lost it here, I am usually quite polite and shy with people but this fella just rubbed me up the wrong way. I stated that if it is a problem for him to put two extra products thourgh he could hit the 2* button for the pasta and 2* for the milk, that would let him only 3 seperate things. In fact my words were "Oh right Sorry, will if it is too much for you to scan 7 products in you /could/ hit the 2* button for the pasta and milk. Ya know, wouldn't want you to get cramp or anything". Fuck he rubbed me up the wrong way.. I got my shopping done btw... but fuck me... what a <b>Wanker</b>
