<p>On the 22nd October I started a new job in <a href="http://www.repknight.com">Repknight</a> based just outside Belfast. I've been here for the last six weeks and I have to say its great being back in a startup. That's not to say I dislike working for established (if that is the right word) businesses. However in a startup you are working with a load of people that have that "shit must be done" attitude, mostly.</p>

<p>There's nothing quite like having a blank whiteboard and the only thing you have is an end goal and you haven't a clue how to get there. Then hashing those ideas out and re-hashing them. It is quite exciting and I forgot how much I missed it.</p>

<p>On the 12th of January 2013 I'll have been working in this industry for 13 years. That's a scary thought. Wonder what the 20 year old version of me would make me of me now (career wise). Probably wondering why I am still working and working out that that the fucking stock options just got must have [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1591723.stm](startup) came to nothing... ;) Cheeky wee rat back then - on my lunch break from the Abbey National I bombed down to the office and said that I'd work as a trainee programmer for 9k a year.</p>

<p>In conclusion I am very happy where I am, the people I work with are brilliant, the atmosphere is excellent and the craic is good. And I'm learning more in one week than I would have anywhere else.</p>
