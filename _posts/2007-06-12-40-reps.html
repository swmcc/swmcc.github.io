I like going to the gym on a Tuesdsay late afternoon. The only thing I don't like is there are too many people there. I am used to having the place almost to myself, but that's my problem.<br /><br />I done the usual, I warmed up on the cross trainer then hit the weights. 50mins today - mostly weights, could have done more but I intend to hit myself real hard tomorrow with the spin and a run tomorrow night. I weighed myself, I am up from Monday but down overall. I hope to be down a bit more tomorrow morning too.<br /><br />5mins warmup on the cross trainer - level 8 1.2km in distance<br />10 * 4 @ 40kg on the lateral raise.<br />15 * 3 @ 54kg on the seated dip<br />10 * 4 @ 54kg on the chest press<br />15 * 3 @ 42kg on the butterfly<br />10 * 3 @ 40kg on the stomach cruncher<br />10mins on the stair master - 5mins at level 8 then 1.30secs on level 12 - then 2mins at level 8 but two at a time with the remainder at level 8.<br />Stretch<br /><br />That was it. I didn't feel drained or anything after it, which is a good sign. I went for a two mile walk at about 10pm just to stretch my legs. I am looking forward to the spin class tomorrow - I intend to really bust myself tomorrow.
