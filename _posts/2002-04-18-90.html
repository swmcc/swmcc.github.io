<h3>Reading</h3>
<br /><p><a href="paul.iconcandy.co.uk">Paul</a> bought me some books for my birthday last week. One of which is titled <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099427745/qid=1019120451/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/202-9139119-7107018">Body of Secrets</a> by James Bamford. It's a book mainly about the NSA and a very good read. I am starting to really enjoy it. He bought me and other book about that fella in the CIA that sold secrets to the Russians for close to 20 years, can't mind the name. It seems very good as well, but I am really enjoying this book.</p>
