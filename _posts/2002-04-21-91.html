<h3>Cinema</h3>
<br /><p>Went to see <a href="http://www.blade2.com/" target="_new">Blade 2</a>. Wasn't a bad watch, quite entertaining. The CGI effects weren't all that impressive. It was a leave your mind at home film, but that is what I wanted, I wasn't in the mood for a deep and meaningful film. So this brings me onto my main thought. While I was watching this film I thought it might be a good idea for me to start writing a short preview to each and every film I see and keep it on my <a href="http://swmcc.com/" target="_new">webshite</a> for future reference. I got a really shit DVD out last night[0] and I was going to rant about how shit it was on my diary. But it struck me when watching Blade 2 that I might as well write something to do it tomorrow or Monday as I am off, and don't start my new <a href="http://www.swmcc.com/frodo/view_journal_entry.cgi/57">job</a> until Thursday. Anyway go to my webshite <a href="http://www.swmcc.com/radagast/index.cgi">stuff</a> section and follow the appropriate link to see it.
