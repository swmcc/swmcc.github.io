<p>In November I <a href="/blog/2013/11/30/most-history-commands/">posted</a> about my twenty most used commands. So here I am six months later and I am doing it agian.</p>

<p>I stopped using <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a> at the start of the year. So my <a href="https://gist.github.com/swmcc/5657497">start_development</a> script doesn't make an appearance. I liked tmux but it wasn't the handiest for paging so I decided to leave it - albeit reluctantly.</p>

<p>Last time ssh wasn't in the running at all. This time it has made a big comeback. I've recently moved most of my stuff to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>. So I guess I was setting up things a fair bit. I don't really expect it to stay around much longer.</p>

<p>sqlite3 made it in but no other db's. I'll keep an eye out for this again next time around.</p>

<p>In work we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a> for lots of things so that's probably why heroku isn't in there too much. For my own stuff I now have a CI server that handles going off to staging/deploying so I don't really need to go near it. Grunt is used for running tests suites and the like.. and probably why node is nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>I am alos suprised that <a href="https://github.com/jonas/tig">tig</a> didn't make it in.</p>

<p>I am pretty happy with it. I would like to see the use of the git command completly handled by alias requests.. Same with rails - but I guess if I am using scaffolding to prototype something I can't get away from it.</p>
