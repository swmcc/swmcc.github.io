<p>
Just like <a href="/2013/01/01/new-year/">2012</a> 2013 was a whirlwind of a year for me, at least professionally.
</p>
<p>One of the personal highlights was being <a href="/2013/02/04/moffett-wedding/">best man</a> at Moffett's wedding at the start of the year. In the middle I had the pleasure of meeting my honorary nephew Oliver McCullough (no relation) for the first time. Then just at the very end my <a href="https://twitter.com/Xtinamccu">sister</a> got engaged to <a href="https://twitter.com/philipbelcher">Philip</a>.</p>
<p>Professionally it was a bit crazy. I changed jobs, again. <a href="http://www.repknight.com">Repknight</a> was a great company to work for. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rejoco">John Reid</a> going outside NI and competing with bigger companies is truly inspirational. I wish there was much more of it in NI. The Belfast team were amazing to work with, I really miss the craic with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jbrevel">Locko</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/davehedo">Dave</a> - my time there was easily the most fun I've had in a working environment. Also as much as it pains to say it two of the loveliest people I have ever worked with worked with me there - <a href="https://twitter.com/debbiecreid">Debbie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/szlwzl">Simon</a>.</p>
<p>In September I moved on to pastures new. I got a job offer from a start up incubator in Belfast. Basically my dream job. I am learning from people ten times smarter than me in a wide breadth of technologies. All in all its the best job I've ever had and the sheer intellectual weight of the other engineers in here is astounding.</p>
<p>I still have a load of personal projects that I need to get time on. However an oil leak at the end of the summer near killed me. The clean up is still happening and as a result I have had next to no time to work on them. Which is very sad but at least in my job I am learning new stuff all the time. I envisage that come around mid Feb my time will start to free up again. Hopefully before that. However at the time of writing I am pretty much working on house stuff constantly.</p>
<p>On another note I have decided to start up my 'own thing'. What this is is still very much at the embryonic stages. I am taking my time and doing it very slowly. Maybe something will come with it - maybe it wont. At least I am giving it a go and when I hear the naysayers, the arm chair commentators or the circle jerk brigade I just laugh. I might fall flat on my face but at least I'm giving it a go.</p>
