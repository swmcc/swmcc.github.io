Even though I have to do the 6mile run today I decided to go to the spin class this mornin. Probably madness, but sure :)<br /><br />The PT failed to turn up, but I wasn't expecting her and the class was more full than Monday so that was nice. The music set was different too, so that was also a nice surprise. I really gunned it as well, I went a bit lighter on the gears than I should have in the fifth song (which was a straight sprint with no hills), but I made up for it (I think) on the reminder of the rounds. In the class we done a lot of hovering, and that kills me.<br /><br />I enjoyed the class, I sweated like it was going out of fashion though, yuck...<br /><br />Weight @ 8am - 111.5kg
