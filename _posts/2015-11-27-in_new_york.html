<p>I got a new <a href="http://www.shopkeep.com">job</a>. It wasnt an easy 
decision to make but made it I did and I am very happy so far. As part of 
the induction into ShopKeep you are sent for an initial two weeks to meet
people, pair with different teams and generally get the feel for the company.

<p>The last time I was in New York I was in Feburary 2004. I went for ten days 
on my own. You may think that going on holiday on your own is an odd thing to 
do, and to a certain degree you would be right. However having holidayed with
other people in the past (groups, partners etc) I can tell you - it is great
just doing what YOU want WHEN YOU want. Don't beat it until you've tried it.</p>

<p>In 2004 when I was away in New York I was actually AWAY. If I had to contact
home it was via a phonecard. This time I just used the wifi and phoned certain 
people on whatsapp.</p>

<p>IN 20
