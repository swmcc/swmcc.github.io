Well I was forced to have Friday as my 'off' day this week again. I should have went running last night but I really couldn't summon the energy. I was in bed for 10.30 and didn't wake up until 9.30 so I guessed I needed the rest. I still don't like it though, but the car has been fixed so I should be back to normal this coming week.<br /><br />I headed to the gym at around 3pm, I didn't really know what I was going to do. I am not following any programme at the minute so I am flying blind at the mo. I done the usual 5min warm up on the cross trainer - but I shoved it up to level 9 this time - and I managed to do 1.25km and my speed was way in the 16's :) When I started I was at level 8 and could just about manage a 10 for about 30secs, so I was well happy with that. The rest of the time was spent doing weights in circuts and at the last a faff about on the treadmill.<br /><br />The treadmill is real boring for me now. I have gotten used to running outside now so staying on the same spot for more than 3mins really gets on my goat. I decided to do 10mins but do sprints so I started of for 1min at 9 and incline 2, then another minute at incline 2 at speed 10. Then at no incline and shoved it up to 11, then down to 9 at incline 2, 3, 3.5 and finally 4 - then shoved up the speed to 12 and hoped or the best :) I done it, but it was very boring and I forgot my ipod.<br /><br />5min warm up on the cross trainer - level 9 - 1.25km - speed average around 14.<br />12 * 3 @ 42kg on the lateral raise.<br />12 * 3 @ 56kg on the seated dip.<br />15 * 3 @ 42kg on the butterfly machine.<br />15 * 3 dips<br />15 * 3 @ 11.42kg each one - lateral chess press.<br />10mins on the treadmill, various levels and inclines - mostly sprints.<br />25 * 4 @ 40kg on the stomach cruncher.<br /><br />Took around an hour. I could have done more as well - but decided agianst it. I wanted to head for 9 holes of golf and then a 2mile run. The 9 holes of golf went well and am just about to go for the run now :)
