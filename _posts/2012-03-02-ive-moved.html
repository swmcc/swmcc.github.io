Hi,

After over a years silence on this thing I've decided to start tinkering again... Anyway I went to upgrade my <a href="http://www.wordpress.com" title="WordPress">wordpress</a> installation only to find out that my version of PHP isn't compatible with it. Instead of upgrading it I just decided to export my blog to a new address... I could do a mod_rewrite thing here as well so its all atomic - but screw it - you wanna read the drivel I will write about then upgrade your links to go <a href="http://swmcc.wordpress.com" title="new blog">http://swmcc.wordpress.com</a>
