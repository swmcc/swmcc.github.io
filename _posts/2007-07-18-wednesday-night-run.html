Well I went for me run :) 3 miles in total. The nike+ thing really does kick ass.<br /><br />The run wasn't too bad, I kept a respectable pace and ran all of it. I suppose now that I can easily do it I should time myself to keep a record. However I done it way too late. By the time I tidied the house, made my tea and other assorted shizzle I looked at the clock and it was 9:55pm!! So I put on my trainers straight away, and ran my little legs off.
