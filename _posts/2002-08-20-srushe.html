<a href="http://www.deeden.co.uk">Steve</a> lives in a flat near the City Hospital. He lives with lots and lots of nurses, yes he has probably heard every joke under the sun. Anyway there is a virus that is going around the City Hospital. I warned him if he gave it to me I would kill him, however on hearing this he came over to my desk and started coughing all over my laptop. Now I was only joking about killing him..... honest....
