Thanks to the kind emails of <a href="http://tracyrif.blogspot.com/">Tracy</a> I have decided to put a 'Training Schedule' on for my six mile run on September the 2nd.<br /><br />To be quite honest, I am not going to train that much for it. I am just going to keep on doing what I am currently doing, only add a few miles here and there. My current thinking is that a 28 year old who trains regularly in the gym should be able to run 6 miles without too much bother.<br /><br />My current training program consists of:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Monday:</span>  (am) Spinning (pm) 2 mile walk or 5 holes of golf<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tuesday:</span> (am) 2 mile run (pm) Heavy Weights<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday:</span> (am) Spinning (pm) 2 mile walk or 5 holes of golf<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Thursday:</span> (am)2 mile run (pm) PM Session<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Friday:</span> (am) Nothing. (pm) 3-4 mile run and some weights<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday:</span> off<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday:</span> Heavy weight session<br /><br />I quite like going to the spin classes, so I am going to keep them. The only thing I will change is changing the 2 mile runs to be 3 miles come the start of August, and then on Fridays actually running 5 miles. Depending on how sore my legs are I suppose I could turn the evening walk into a run, but I'll see how things go first.<br /><br />I have the sis talked into going to a spin class this afternoon. It isn't the usual fella I go to, so the class should be a bit more interesting with new music and hopefully a different set. If I like the class I think I will change one of my morning spin classes to a Friday evening.<br /><br />I have also decided to stop weighing myself every damn time I am in the gym, it is of no actual use. The next time I will weigh myself is Monday. So from now on I will report on a Monday weight and a Thursday (PT Session) weight.<br /><br />I am also going to start some KB training to keep things fresh. That should make a nice mix of cardio and weights. But that's another two weeks away.
