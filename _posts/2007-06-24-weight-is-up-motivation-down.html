I am usually highly motivated about going to the gym. I love how it makes me feel and the benefits are huge. However I really do need someone to kick the crap out of me regarding my diet. The PT is away on holiday for a week, so that's no official weigh in for 2weeks. Now in saying that she might grab me when she sees me in the gym next and weigh me, but I doubt it.<br /><br />I am really disappointed in myself, I let myself go /again/. This is happening way too often for my own comfort. I wont say what I ate, but I ate a lot and now I feel like shit on a stick.<br /><br />I have to help my Dad around the house today, and he's a slow worker so I had to nip into the gym real early (for a Sunday) and get my sets done. My legs are still burning, so I ignored any cardio work again.<br /><br />5mins cross trainer level 9 - 1.23km<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit:</span><br />3 * 12 @ 56kg seated row (with each set on a different position)<br />3 * 15 @ 35kg Arm Curl<br /><br />4 * 15 @ 50kg Seated dip<br />4 * 15 @ 50kg Chest Press<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit:</span><br />3 * 12 @ 42kg Pectoral Fly<br />3 * 12 @ 35kg Rear Deltoid<br /><br />I only could do 45mins before I had to go. I could have gotten up earlier, but I didn't. I am not sure if it is a combination of things, or if it is the fact that the PT is not going be there to kick my ass. I dunno. But I don't like this feeling.<br /><br />Weight @ 11.30am - 112.6!!! (I feel like shit on a stick big time).
