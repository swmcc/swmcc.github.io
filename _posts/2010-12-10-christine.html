I want this blog just to be about technical stuff but like anything else things happen and reminds you about certain things. At the start I said that I have changed in the last five years, well that is true – I have. One of the biggest changes is that I’ve met someone (as wanky as that sounds) and she’s easily the best thing to ever happen to me.

Almost three years since we decided to make a go of it – but its three years since we first started to see each other in a dating way! Time does fly!

As I said.. bestest!
