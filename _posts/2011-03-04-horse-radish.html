Well so far so good on the 'this blog will be about technical issues only' resolution when I first started. :)

Me and a fella from work (Niall) were talking yesterday about things we hate and things we like. Exciting times :) Anyway we got to talking about olives and how pre twenty five I hated then when I was over twenty five I started to like them. Naill said that if you taste something fifteen times your taste buds become used to it and you start to like it. He did this with olives which he hated at first, then as time went on he started to tolerate them and then finally loves them. So much so that he orders olives in his subway sandwiches now.

I want to put this to the test.. One of the things I can't abide are peanuts I think they are stinking but I would like to tolerate it if I can. As an adult its important not to have a gag reflex when attending somewhere where you have got to eat something that contains peanuts. Another thing I cannot abide is horseradish, in mu opinion it spoils a lovely steak or sandwich. It has no business being anywhere near something I want to consume. Niall also hates horseradish...

Over the next three weeks (that is fifteen work days) Niall and I will take a spoonful of this awfulÂ abomination every day and hopefully slowly we will start to like it. First thing is to procure some of this filth on my weekly shop!

Stay tuned - updates coming..
