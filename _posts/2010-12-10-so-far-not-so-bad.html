So far not so bad on the <a href="http://www.virpus.com/" target="_blank">Virpus</a> server I host this on.. Its still not the best though – but for $5 a month I can’t bitch. I don’t really bomb into the shell that much on this server, everything is remotely done on either my home machine or my lovvveeelly mac book – and the email is hosted by google services.. But I just did this – not good -but as I said – $5 a month..</p>

Which reminds me – must update the system clock. Its doing my nut in the server being <a href="http://www.centos.org/" target="_blank">Centos</a> though, I tried to install irssi on it and it wasn’t found straight off.. I did a bit of searching and it can be done – but I just want to ‘apt-get install <a href="http://irssi.org/" target="_blank">irssi</a>‘ – I don’t want to have to mess around with different lists and sources just to get something as simple as irrsi installed. I think during the holidays next month I’ll take an afternoon and switch to <a href="http://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">debian</a>. Makes life simple – just gotta be sure to select the right distro on the sign up page this time <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" /></p>

Talking of holidays I got this email on Wednesday from Virpus. While nice of them to let me know they are shut and stuff – there is no point in saying Happy Holidays to me. I could see if it was for Christmas or something – but as far as I know Thanksgiving is an American holiday (I think). Either road – it was lazy of them not to check my country and see that as I am from the UK that it aint a holiday for moi.. But as I keep saying – $5… Can’t be bad to it – but I better get an email at Christmas from them.</p>
