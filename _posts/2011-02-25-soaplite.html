In work I was given the task of writing an API for something. Being the old dinosaur I am I wrote it using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLRPC">XMLRPC</a> protocol. Mainly cos its simple, I've written a few using it before and Perl gives me a nice interface to it all in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/RPC-XML/lib/RPC/XML.pm">XML::RPC</a>. All in all writing the API wasn't hard - using it is even easier. XMLRPC is very old but it is simple and that's why I like it. If I had more time I would have written in it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">JSON-RPC</a> but time was short and this got it done quickly, cheaply and more importantly it kept the customer happy.</p>

<p>
The second part of this project entailed me using the API that they have. And to my horror it was using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP_(protocol)">SOAP</a>. I find SOAP very complicated to use. Maybe its a mental block I have with it. Who knows - but I am not alone in my thinking that its a huge mess to deal with. I started with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mkutter/SOAP-WSDL-2.00.10/lib/SOAP/WSDL.pm">SOAP::WSDL</a> but it wasn't playing nice. I found the lack of documentation annoying. I wanted to edit certain things in the headers but found it too confusing. I said to the #cabal and <a href="http://www.jaffs.com">Jaffs</a> kindly pointed me in the direction of  <a href="http://ditchnet.org/soapclient/">SOAP Client</a>. In the end I reverted to using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mkutter/SOAP-Lite-0.712/lib/SOAP/Lite.pm">SOAP::Lite</a>. Am sure that SOAP::WSDL could have done what I wanted but it was taking too long. So I hammered out a script really quickly then got to manipulating the headers to what SOAP Client was passing in to ensure that it worked. A very nasty way to get it to work. I found the lack of documentation and example scripts annoying. So here is mine - I kept the 'trace' on so I could see exactly what was happening.</p>

If you are reading this and thinking of writing your own web service please don't do it in SOAP.. It makes programmers go bald!</p>

Example Code:
<pre>
<div id="_mcePaste">#!/usr/bin/perl</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">use strict;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">use warnings;</div>
<div>use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; 'all';</div>
<div>my $soap = SOAP::Lite-&gt;new( proxy =&gt; 'http://xxxxxxxx.com/xxxxxxx.asmx');</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">$soap-&gt;default_ns('http://tempuri.org/');</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">$soap-&gt;on_action(sub { join '', @_ });</div>
<div>my $method = SOAP::Data-&gt;name('UploadXML')-&gt;attr({xmlns =&gt; 'http://tempuri.org/'});</div>
<div>my $date = (</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">SOAP::Data-&gt;name('input')-&gt;value(SOAP::Data-&gt;name('DATE_PROVIDED')-&gt;value('2011-02-24'))</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">);</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">my @param = (</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">SOAP::Data-&gt;name('REQUEST_NUMBER')-&gt;value('1'),</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">SOAP::Data-&gt;name('ID')-&gt;value('1'),</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">$date,</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">SOAP::Data-&gt;name('DATA')-&gt;value('1'),</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">);</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">my $run = $soap-&gt;call($method =&gt; @param);</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">die $run-&gt;fault-&gt;{ faultstring } if ($run-&gt;fault);</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">print $run-&gt;result, "n";</div></pre>
I plugged the above into the code and it has worked nicely since. What a waste of good hair!
