Well I did a bit more digging and found my old blog from 2005-2006.. So that’s just the tail end of 2003 and 2004 to find (I think this only exists on the <a href="http://www.archive.org/" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> – screen scrape <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" /> ).

It was in <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" target="_blank">Moveable Type</a> and luckily for this they allowed you to build the HTML for the site. Obviously no searching works or anything. It would be too nasty to it all integrated into the current <a href="../../" target="_blank">site</a> so it will sit on its old subdomain – called bilbo.

I don’t old the own domain anymore, so I just had to do a quick search and replace in the directory for the archives and things started to work.
<pre>find . -type f| xargs sed -i 's/xxxx.com/bilbo.swm.cc/g'</pre>
So, here it is – my <a href="http://bilbo.swm.cc/" target="_blank">blog</a> circa 2005-2006. Only one more ‘era’ to go and that’s pretty much it. I hope I shoved my old mail in here… Will look tomorrow – lunch is almost up!
