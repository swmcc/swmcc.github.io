I love my <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone</a>. I think its one of the best buys I have made in a long time. It just works. Like all <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a> products it has won me over after a few years of me saying “I don’t need to have a mini computer in my pocket!”.

I don’t want to go into detail on what apps I use reguarly. So instead I took a screen shot of my windows and you can see what apps I use most. The only app I am not sure about is the <a href="http://instagr.am/" target="_blank">Instagr.am</a> app. I see it popping up on twitter a good bit – mostly by shoreditch assholes that follow every trend over the sun. I thought I would give it a go though – it might be of use – jury is out.
