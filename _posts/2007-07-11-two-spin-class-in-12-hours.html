Well that's two spin classes down in twelve hours. Which I never really thought that much about until now. As stated before I wanted to do more cardio work this week.<br /><br />Yesterday morning I done a 2mile run before breakfast, then after work I done a spin class. I really pushed myself hard in that class, was quite proud of myself.<br /><br />This mornings class was exactly the same set of songs as yesterdays. I don't really like that if I am honest. I prefer different songs to keep my head out of it, but sure that is a minor fault. I couldn't push myself as hard this morning, I just couldn't. My legs are very tight and tired and now and even getting up the stairs to work was a big deal :)<br /><br />And to add to the whole thing I have a PT session at 3.30pm today - so at the time of writing have around 6 hours to rest me legs :) Should be fun, eh?<br /><br />Weight @ 8am - 111kg.<br /><br />I am not that worried about my weight this week, I know I have been good in my training, and my diet has been good. I suppose I could do more weights, but am gonna wait until the weekend for that. I have a feeling that the weight is gonna zoom off come the weekend. So hurraaah :)
