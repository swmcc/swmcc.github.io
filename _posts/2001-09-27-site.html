Hi.. sorry about some of the links but I haven't had time to go through every single one and fix them - that's for another day. I recently updated my webserver to actually work (Note: Never use SID as a webserver - potato is the only way to go and you give yourself a world of hurt if you don't do it at the start). The whole thing should be working again, soon.
