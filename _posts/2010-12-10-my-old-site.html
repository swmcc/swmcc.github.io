I said yesterday about my <a href="../2010/12/08/backing-up/" target="_blank">nostalgia</a> kick on the <a href="http://www.archive.org/" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>. I found my old blog (in fact there were two now thinking about it in different guises – must look that up.. I should screen scrape them). Well during the first half hour of my lunch break I went and looked in an old BlackStar/Sendit/VHS server that is still on… And what do you know – my old backups exist! So far I have only found the ones from 2000-2003 – they were on the old mentioned machine from Computastore!

Now this was before I moved to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" target="_blank">Moveable Type</a> for the blog and wrote my own blogging software, idiot that I was. And it looks like I wrote it in much the same way that MT behaved. I didn’t have a db interface to the entries I simply must have had a file that built the HTML. More than likely I was using <a href="http://template-toolkit.org/docs/tools/tpage.html" target="_blank">tpage</a>. I backed up the web files, templates, modules and the tables. Well I only backed up the schema of each table – no data <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" /> Idiot <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" />

So blog searching doesn’t work. I also took away the ability to send something through the old ‘contact me’ page. Another thing that I took away was the old link page, which I called zebedee quite stupidly. It (if I remember correctly) was a page that took an id and looked up a db table – and then redirected you to that site while at the same time setting a counter on that link – that was it! Pretty useless if you ask me. But I guess I had my reasons! I had to amend this page obviously since there is no db data for the table. Hopefully most of my links will be descriptive enough for the user to know where they were going to go.

It is very odd reading it to be honest. 2000-2003 – When I worked for BlackStar, CV3, Bytel, BlackStar. It is odd to hear of me talking about being 23 and even odder to hear that my sister was at school doing GCSE’s – when she’s a fully qualified nurse now! I also came across an entry about Shane McCullough’s 21st birthday party – which is really odd since I am attending his 30th birthday on Saturday night!

Anyway enough with this.. If you want to have a look – please do so – <a href="http://old.swm.cc/" target="_blank">old.swm.cc</a>
