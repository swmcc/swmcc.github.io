I haven't been to the gym in over two weeks!! Actually it will be two weeks tomorrow. And I feel awful for it. I know that I have gained weight and that is really annoying me. From going 5 times a week for an hour a time to going to nothing is hard to take.<br /><br />I got a bad case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitus">cellulitus</a> on my right leg and as a result was in bed for a week. And when I mean I was in bed I actually mean I was in bed. I have been on my feet since Saturday but the leg is still tender, the swelling has gone down and the redness is almost gone.<br /><br />I go back to the gym tomorrow. I know the weight is going to be up, and I have to get it into my head that there is nothing I can do about it. Just accept it, see where it is tomorrow and move on. I haven't over ate, I haven't eaten bad things. The medication I am on made my stomach feel like a washing machine. But just lying around the house not being able to move has driven me a bit nuts and I just want to be back the way I was three weeks ago.<br /><br />The other thing that is annoying me is how far it has set me back. I know my leg wont be back to 100% for another few weeks and that I wont be able to run outside or on the treadmill for at least a week or two. That is also annoying me. I was doing well there for a while, I was runing two miles in the morning (treadmill) with a mile run on the road in the evening. I wonder how long it will be before I can do that again? This time two months ago I couldn't even run a mile without wanting to faint. And it would be a kick in the crotch to be back to that stage again.<br /><br />However all this is negative. I know I have come far in the last 5 months, further than I thought I could. So maybe when my leg gets back to normal I will find myself progressing faster than I did before.<br /><br />Tomorrow shall be interesting. I want to see what I can do, how much I weigh and more importantly how I feel. I'll post up what happened tomorrow.
