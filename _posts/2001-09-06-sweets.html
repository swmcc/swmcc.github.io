Ruthie & I went to the shop to get Jelly Beans and she finally told me that she got a 2:1 in her degree.. So 4 months later.... congrats !!!

She was also bitching about me putting up her photo in my pics section so I have made an executive ;-) decision and took her off. So until she asks really nicely for me to put her back up again she will never grace the walls of swmcc.com at all, she knows I'm serious - she is not allowed to eat /any/ biscuts in my house 'cos she 'Dosen't like *ordinary* Hob-Nobs'.
