Apparently Beryl was complaining about me not updating my diary enough... I think I update it on a pretty regular basis compared to other people. But to keep Beryl happy I am posting this, and maybe she will send me an email that I actually get this time :) She also complained that she couldn't email me through the contact page... So you can email here.
