<h3>A pleasent suprise</h3>
<br /><p>People that know me well will know that I hate <a href="http://swmcc.com/bilbo/zebedee.cgi/47" target="_new">Kevin Bacon</a>. I don't know him personally but I think my hatered stems back to <a href="http://swmcc.com/bilbo/zebedee.cgi/48" target="_new">Footloose</a> , a truly awful film. Since then I have hated the man, he just sums up the 80's in word - Shite. Anyway I was watching T.V last night and I came across the film <a href="http://swmcc.com/bilbo/zebedee.cgi/49">Murder in the First</a>. And I have to say Bacon plays a brilliant role, I was very impressed. So maybe my opinon on Bacon was wrong... time will tell. However if he makes another film like Footloose......
<br /></p>
<br /><p>But the 80's did suck</p>
