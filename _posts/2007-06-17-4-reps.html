Sunday, my usual heavy weight day. However this time I decided to go for less weight and more reps, just to keep things interesting.<br /><br />Usual 5min warm up on the cross trainer - hit the 20's and managed 1.35km, but I was gunning it. Then a series of weights then 10mins on the stair master. Yes, I made my target and instead of doing 20mins I done 10 - that woman is a fqn nutter :)<br /><br />5mins on the cross trainer level 9<br />15 * 4 @ 42kg on the lateral raise<br />15 * 4 @ 49kg on the lateral pull down<br />15 * 4 @ 49kg on the chest press<br />15 * 4 @ 11kg on the pully machine - triceps extensions<br />15 * 4 @ 14kg free weight arm curls<br />10mins on the stair master:<ul><li> 5mins @ level 8</li><li> 1.30secs @ level 12</li><li> 2mins @ level 8 - taken two at a time</li><li> 1.30secs @ level 8.</li></ul><br />5mins on the treadmill:<br /><ul><li> 1min @ speed 12 - no incline</li><li>  1min @ speed 9 - incline 1.5</li><li>  1min @ speed 13 - no incline</li><li>  30secs @ speed 9 - incline 2</li><li>  30secs @ speed 10 - incine 3</li><li>  30secs @ speed 9 incline 4.5</li></ul><br />I wanted to do some skipping too, but the foopin studio was being used, so I didnae get to do that. I ran 3miles on Sunday night too - went and bought myself one of those nike+ thangs, well worth it I think. I didn't get to do any golf on Sunday as it was Fathers Day.<br /><br />Weight @ 3pm - 112.8kg
