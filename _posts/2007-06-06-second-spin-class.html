Well the second class done. I enjoyed it, however I must have lost inches around my belly cos my fucking track bottoms did not want to stay up! Luckily there weren't many in the class so there was no-one behind me. I must procure a new pair at the weekend because I couldn't give the class my full effort for fear of me kaks falling down :)<br /><br />I really enjoyed it, and the PT was there too - but I got the impression that she was there only cos I was gonna be there. But I think that's the whole point of the exercise :)<br /><br />I didn't have time for a warm up, and to be honest I don't think I really need one so from now on I'll just go there and set up.<br /><br />I kept up to speed with most of it I think, I could have went harder on the resistance side but I wanted to know if I could keep up and I did so I was pleased with that. Another two weeks of taking it easy on the resistance should pay off and then I will start to give it more.<br /><br />I sweated like a donkey again this time which was disgusting, but everyone was on the same boat - I just sweat a bit more than the average person. I am really enjoying doing something new.<br /><br />My legs are still pretty tight and tired. I wanted to go for a run last night, but I decided to go for a leisurely 3mile walk instead. I might do a 1mile run tonight followed by a 1mile walk - but I will see.<br /><br />Seeing the PT tomorrow, and I weighed myself this morning and am down the 1kg again to what I was at the start of the week.. Weird :) Hopefully by tomorrow I will be down a bit more :)
