Well after the last week of no motivation I thought this weeks PT session would be very hard - and boy was I right :) I was actually looking forward to it and as much as I hate to admit it I did miss having her around. So anyway.. the session was very hard. I didn't do many machine exercises, it was mostly mat work in circuts and it killed.<br /><br />5 min warm up on the cross trainer at level 9.<br />Mat work for 20mins, sit ups, sit ups with a ball, a cycle thing that is a very hard sit up.<br /><br />Circut (3 times):<br />10 Good Morning Presses with some mad weight on a barbell.<br />10 Lunges with a barbell at some mad weight across my shoulders.<br />10 Upright row with the same barbell<br />A 2min session on a spin bike with the resistance all the way up.<br />10 press-ups<br />10 seated dips<br /><br />Circut (3 times)<br />20 punches each arm (1st time slow, second time fast, 3rd time really slow) with 4kg barbells<br />20 chest presses each arm (1st time slow, second time fast, 34d time really slow) with 4kg barbells.<br /><br />10mins on the treadmill:<br /><br /><ul><li>1min at level 7</li><li>1min at level 8 with incline at 1.5</li><li>1min at level 8 with no incline</li><li>1min at level 9 with incline at 2 (I started to see a pattern emerging here ;) )</li><li>1min at level 9.5 with no incline</li><li>1min at level 10 with incline at 4!!!</li><li>1min at level 7 with no incline</li><li>1min at level 8 with incline at 4.5</li><li>1min at level 9 with incline at 5</li><li>1min at level 7 with no incline</li></ul>3 * 10 sets of the plank at 10seconds each, with the last one of the last set held for 15 (this killed).<br />3 * 10 sets of press-ups, with a final hold in mid position for 10seconds (the final one in the final set was held for 15).<br /><br />And that was that :) I really enjoy the mat work, although I find it very very hard. I am glad she is back.<br /><br />Motivation is back, and I am gonna make my target for the end of the month too :)<br /><br />Weight @ 4pm: 110kg (very very happy. My target is 108 by the end of this month :) ).
