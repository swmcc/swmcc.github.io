<p>My 'startup'. Take ideas in, digest, apps come out.. Apparently!</p>
<p>This site is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>.
As I am busy building other apps under the Skillfulgorilla brand I've
let this site slide a bit. Hopefully putting it front and center here
will shame me into actually using it.</p>
