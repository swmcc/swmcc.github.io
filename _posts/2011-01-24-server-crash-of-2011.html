Well my server crashed last <a href="http://swm.cc/a/31564/">week</a>. Seems that <a href="http://www.virpus.com/">Virpus</a> got hacked and lost all their nodes :( Now shit happens so you can't hold that against them. However not to have a disaster recovery plan is a bit mad but then again for $5 a month I am not complaining, as I've said <a href="http://swm.cc/blog/2010/12/10/so-far%E2%80%A6-not-so-bad%E2%80%A6/">before</a> :)</p>

<p>
I used my own <a href="http://swm.cc/blog/2010/12/10/backing-up/">backups</a> from Dropbox. Everything important was there apart from the databases. I don't know what happened but for some reason they just weren't there :( A real pain in the ass that is I can tell you! I got /most/ of my blog articles from my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> account, exported them out and then with some jiggery pokery in PERL and bunged it into the database. I am missing a few entries which is annoying, if anyone can help out with that I would be thankful.</p>

<p>
As well as losing a few entries I also lost the tag cloud information and the dates of any articles written before the 10th of December 2010. Again a pain in the ass but nothing massive. It wont take long for it to come back again with the new entries. I re-installed <a href="http://swm.cc/blog/2011/01/12/url-shortner/">shorty</a> for links, obviously old ones wont work but sure.</p>

<p>
I will have to put up a 404 page to explain why a certain entry isn't available if anything references it and point them back to the search page. Other than that its all done.</p>

<p>
My main complaint is that I will have to re-install <a href="http://swm.cc/blog/2011/01/11/personal-tv-project-part-one/">XMLTV</a> - it was a pain, I'll probably do that on Thursday night during <a href="http://swm.cc/blog/2010/12/10/thursday-nights/">Question Time</a>. The sneaky script I had to get the star pictures is now useless. Grrrrrrr...</p>

<p>
Luckily because I use <a href="http://swm.cc/blog/2010/12/10/handling-email/">Google for Domains</a> for my email it wasn't that big a deal to lose everything. Just a tad annoying. I hope Virpus recover from this but it wont be known until Feb 2012 in my opinion. Those businesses and people that had their servers with them and paid for a years subscription wont move straight away. That is the main problem with outages - the damage they cause cannot be measured for at least a year :/ I am keeping my options open and it better not happen again.</p>

<p>
It will take a few months before I get everything installed that I had before, things like that just take time. Ahh well.. I am back and that's all that matters :)</p>
