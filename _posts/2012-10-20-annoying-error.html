Getting a rather annoying error on my server every time I log in and try install something via aptitude. It was pissing me off enough that I had to fix it. Hopefully google will pick this up and it will be handy for someone else to fix if they have this problem. The error was:</p>

<pre>
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
LANGUAGE = (unset),
LC_ALL = (unset),
LANG = “en_GB.UTF-8″
are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (“C”).
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
Setting up bind9 (1:9.7.3.dfsg-1ubuntu2.7) …
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
</pre>
<p>
Easy enough fixed with:</p>

<pre>
root@gandalf ~]# locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8 hu_HU hu_HU.UTF-8

en_US.ISO-8859-1… done

No hand holding on this post. If  you can understand the above then you should be able to work out what the fuck I just did :)</p>
