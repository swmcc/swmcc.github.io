So after the spin class in the morning my legs felt tight as I really gunned it during the class. After work I headed straight back to the gym and got ready for my run. However I didn't just want to go and run so I done a few weights before hand.<br /><br />The fella I was supposed to go running with cancelled on me /again/. Its his problem though, thinking about doing something doesn't get something done. If it did I would be more than happy but it doesn't. The PT asked me if he was coming and I just said he never bothered to get back to me either road. But I am heading at 5.30 for a quick run and if he is here, he is here. Now the PT is so nice she was straight on the phone and asking him if he was coming down. He told me he'd ring me tomorrow to sort out another time. I am tellin ya, if it wasn't for the fact that the PT wants me to take him out I would use my three favourite words "Go Fuck Yourself". Anyway that is just a minor rant.<br /><br />5min warm up on the bike level 9 (I can't remember the distance).<br />10 * 3 @ 56kg on the seated row (all three grips).<br />10 * 3 @ 62kg on the chest press.<br />10 * 3 @ 56kg on the lateral pull down.<br />10 * 3 @ 48kg on the butterfly machine.<br />15 * 3 @ 22.5kg shoulder press free weight.<br />15 * 3 @ 14kg each arm bicep curl free weight.<br />15 * 3 press ups.<br /><br />No sign of the man, went on ahead. The sun was out it was pretty warm, but since my goal is to lose weight I kept my t-shirt on and shoved a water proof running coat over it. I must have looked like a donkey, but sure... Half way in it started to rain cats and dogs, but since I was covered in sweat anyway it didn't make any difference to me :)<br /><br />4 mile run. I didn't time myself, and since I thought I was going with the 'udder fella' I didn't bring my Ipod and Nike+.
