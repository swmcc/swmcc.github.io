So, Christina went to the Dentists today. She went to that special dentist down the Lisburn Rd. They knock you out and then you come out drunk and not aware that there is a whole in your gob.
They made a cockup with mine, well actually it was my dentist that made it impossible for the tooth to be pulled out, so they dug it out. Anyway I didn't feel any pain while they were doing it. Christina did. She has three teeth growing out of the roof of her mouth so they had to come out, and apparently she felt everything. Which is rather shite :( She was in so much pain that her legs were kicking.

But the worst is over now, but now she will be scared to go in as I told her that you don't feel anything.

Luckily it wasn't me that went in this time, as if I would have felt any pain I would have decked someone. I don't have a good relationship with my doctor or my dentist. I hate being touched, especially when ppl cause me pain and want me to pay for it.

I just re-read that last paragraph, and you could take it the wrong way :)
