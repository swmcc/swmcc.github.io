So after my stupid idea of having two spin classes in 12 hours, then a mere 6 hours after the final spin class to have a PT session I am done :)<br /><br />The PT Session was quite good if I am honest. Through out the day my legs were getting tighter and tighter and tighter.  I was expecting to be a cripple come 3.30pm but I was okay, for the most part.<br /><br />The PT started off by weighing me and I was done another 1kg (2.2lbs). Woo-hoo. I thought I was gonna stay the same this week, and then lose a shit load come the weekend. I still think that is gonna happen, so I hope to reach my goal this weekend (that would make me a week and a half sooner than I thought). Anyway that was a nice suprise.<br /><br />Then 10mins on the treadmill, then into the studio for some circuts with my legs, then up stairs to the weights and done a circut on my arms and shoulders. Then after that 15mins on the stair master, in which I near fell off:<br /><br /><blockquote>Me: I fucking hate this stair master. What machines do you really hate?<br />PT [very drollie]: I fucking hate everyone. Every single fucking one.<br />Me [trying not to laugh as I was getting it tight]: Oh...</blockquote><br /><br />I love a droll sence of humour and that hit me right in my funny bone. It is still making me laugh now. Anyway after that we done some mat work, that hoit then after that a 5min cycle on the hand cycle thing at the top level!!<br /><br />I think she was a bit impressed at the stair master, as she said "I remember the day when you couldn't even do level 5 for 1min.." and she is correct. Sometimes I find it hard to think how far I have come in terms of fitness. I seen the bro for the first time today in about 3 weeks and the first thing he said was "Fuck me, you've lost the weight a good bit". Which is always nice to hear.<br /><br />10min on the treadmill<br /><ul><li>2mins at level 8</li><li>2mins at level 9 at incline 1.5</li><li>1min at level 8</li><li>2mins at level 9.5 no incline</li><li>1min at level 9.5 incline 2.5</li><li>1min at level 9.5 incline 3.5</li><li>1min at level 9.5 incline 4</li></ul>(I actually found that pretty easy to be honest, even with my legs burning)<br /><br />[Circuit]<br />10 * 3 @ 35kg free weight - Leg squats (barbell on my shoulders).<br />10 * 3 Jumping squats onto a platform.<br />Various body balance stuff,<br /><br />[Circuit]<br />(below was alternated between the other sets)<br />15 * 1 @ 15kg shoulder press machine.<br />15 * 1 @ 20kg shoulder press machine.<br />15 * 1 @ 25kg shoulder press machine.<br />10  * 4kg each raised arm extensions (those hoit).<br />1min 6kg ball hitting the PT's raised hands while she was on a platform.<br />(This circuit killed my arms).<br /><br />15 mins on the stair master:<br /><ul><li>1min at level 8</li><li>1min at level 9</li><li>(repeated 4 times).</li><li>1min at level 8</li><li>1min at level 12</li></ul>(this also wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. However if I had done another set of 8 and 12 I would have gotten it real tight).<br /><br /><br />Mat work - this killed and was very very hard. Held the plank for 30secs for 3 sets of 1. Boy that hoit :)<br /><br />5mins on the hand cycle. I can't really remember much at this stage apart from that at the end it was at level 12 and I was lucky if I was hitting 20rpm :)<br /><br />Weight at 3.30 - 109kg - whoo-hoooo :) :)<br /><br />Feel great too. I *heart* my PT even though she does scare me.
