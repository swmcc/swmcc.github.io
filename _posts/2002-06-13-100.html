<h3>Free Time</h3>
<br /><p>While walking out to Lunch Duggie and I were talking about free time and how little we have of it. Now I have been thinking this for sometime now. While I was working for Bytel I worked a straight 35hour week, but now I am in BlackStar and have lots more work to do and actually find it interesting I am working 45-50hrs per week. Now there is nothing wrong with this, but it became apparent to me last night that I need to set aside some time for myself. On Sunday the exhaust came of my car and I haven't had time to get it fixed, nevermind having playtime for myself. The problem is by the time I leave work and walk to the carpark it is near 7:30 and then I have to drive home by which time it is 8:00. Then when I get home there is always an errand to run or something equally trival to suck up about half an hour. That means I am not getting settled until 9:30 :(</p>
<br /><p>None of this is BlackStars fault of course, it is just mine - but I am going to have set aside sometime for myself and actually get organised. Now this has to be worse for Duggie as he is moving house and stuff..</p>
<br /><b>Oh yeah, and I must get myself a life.... :)</b>
