This diary bit is now database driven, YAY.... What took me so long I will never now - it only took half-an-hour and after all I program for a living so I should have done it ages ago... Anyway there should be more regular updates from now on as it is alot easier to add an entry now.

I'm getting on slowly with swmcc.com Paul said he will knock up a few buttons and design me a new footer so hopefully that should be coming soon. I'll make this section searchable and such crap

I have also added a new section to the site. It is a portal and will have slashdot new articles and all the general crap that a portal does. ATM it only has BlackStar's Top 20 DVD's & Videos. More will be added soon. Click here to have a look-see..

Thanks
