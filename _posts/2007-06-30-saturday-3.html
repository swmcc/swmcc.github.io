I think the shock of the weight on Thursday evening got to me. I meant to go to the gym on Friday morning as in the evening I have other commitments. However I didn't get to sleep until 4am and slept in.<br /><br />I woke up on Saturday morning and done what messages I had to do and then went to the gym. I wasn't going to weigh myself, but I knew that I had been good on Friday and that the work I done on Thursday was good enough to lose a bit. I wanted to do more cardio this time.<br /><br />5mins on the cross trainer - 1.3km<br />10mins on the stair master:<br /><br /><ul><li>5mins at level 9</li><li>1min at level 12</li><li>2.30mins a level 9 taking them two at a time</li><li>1.30 level 13</li></ul>3 * 15 @ 14kg each - free weights bicep curl<br />3 * 15 @ 40kg tricep extension on the pully machine<br />3 * 15 @ 56kg chest press<br /><br />10mins on the treadmill:<br /><br /><ul><li>3mins at level 9 incline 1.5</li><li>1min at level 13 no incline</li><li>1min at level 9 incline 3</li><li>1min at level 10 incline 3.5</li><li>2mins at level 8 incline 4.5</li><li>1.30 at level 13 no incline</li><li>30secs at level 14 on incline</li></ul>3 * 15 @ 35kg bicep curl<br />3 * 15 @ 56kg on lateral pulldown wide grip<br />3 * 15 @ 13.75kg each on incline chest press<br />3 * 15 @ 17.5kg seated shoulder press<br />3 * 15 seated dips<br /><br />Today was good, I felt good about it and I have my motivation back. But am dog tired. I also played 5 holes of golf today, but as I was so tired I didn't play that well but it was a nice walk.<br /><br />Weight at 2pm - 112.7kg
