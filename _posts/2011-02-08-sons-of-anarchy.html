I said a while <a href="http://swm.cc/blog/2011/01/11/personal-tv-project-part-one/">back</a> that I came across a new show that I liked the look of - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Anarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a>. Thanks to a quick holiday trip to the States and coming across a channel that showed nothing but this show for a week I managed to see all three seasons (so far). It has to be said - it was an amazing show. Still nowhere near as good as mightyÂ  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing">West Wing</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos">The Sopranos</a> - but in these days of a show getting canned within 2 minutes of the first show its very good.</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katey_Sagal">Katy Saga</a>l and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_pearlman">Ron Pearlman</a> are excellent as always. The main character Jax played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hunnam">Charlie Hunnam</a> is very good also - he carries the series very well even though he sounds like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rude_Dog">Rude Dog</a>.</p>

<p>
The thing that kept me interested in the show as the 'Irish Connection' they had. The Sons are a gun running firm and they get their guns from a group called the 'True IRA'. In the three seasons I saw they always had a character that represented someone from the TI. They even went as far to come to Belfast in Season 3 and this is where it gets interesting.</p>

<p>
They painted Belfast as being dark (check), dreary (check) in a state of civil war (nope). biker gangs common in Belfast (nope). In contrast they showed the North Coast run from Larne to Carrickfergus as nice (I am sure it is if you stop thinking that this road connects two places as crap as Carrick and Larne) and the usual back roads with no motorways. This is to be expected in fiction though I don't mind that. I also didn't mind that the accents were possibly the worst I have ever heard. Our accent is very hard to copy and a TV Show can't really get into that sort of detail without adding to the costs. So all forgiven. So in summary I didn't mind the following:</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Showing Belfast to be some sortta village with no major roads in or out.</li>
	<li>Having our accents change with every character.</li>
	<li>Showing the houses that we live in are still from 1937.</li>
	<li>That the 'NI Police' are a militant force that drive about wanting to kill anyone that doesn't wear a sash.</li>
	<li>That everything is green and we sit around playing tin whistles.</li>
	<li>We are in constant civil war where the two sides are still beating the life out of each other.</li>
	<li>That there are constant gun runs between Belfast and Dunloy on a daily basis and that five bikers can protect such a run.</li>
</ul>

No.. The above points are all fair game - its TV so lets give them a bit of artistic licence. The one thing I can't get over though and it really took away from them being in Belfast was this line - after a car was shot up by a group of fellas in masks:</p>

<pre>"Who was that Sean, who ordered the hit?

That was the UDA that shot your car up. It was a warning sign - they wanted to send a message to Jimmy. If the UDA wanted you dead you would be!"</pre>
<p>
Come on!!!! Everyone knows that they couldn't carry out a successful shopping trip never mind that. So if you are reading this dear SoA writer please replace the above dialog with this:</p>
<pre>"Who set us up Sean, who ordered the hit?

It was the UDA.

How do you know that?

They fucked it up!"</pre>
Yes.. lets not stretch the artistic licence on this show that far :)
