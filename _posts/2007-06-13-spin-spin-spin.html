My fourth spin class. Not as enjoyable as the class on Monday, maybe its because my legs are a bit tired, or maybe the class actually was harder. Either way I done what I wanted, I shoved up the resistance more than I would have on Monday, not by much - but enough.<br /><br />The air con was broke in the studio so I sweated lots more than I should have. For me that is a good thing, for the fit type dudes and dudettes it was bad. I kept up for most of it, the third and fourth songs were torture. I don't find the climbing too bad, but the sprinting on a high gear on the seat is absolute torture for me.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed the class, I can see myself progressing in it bit by bit. I am still gonna go for my run tonight. Then its the PT session tomorrow. My weight was down as well, so hopefully this session will help an ickle bit.
