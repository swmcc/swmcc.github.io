<h3>At last..</h3>
<br /><p>Well, as most of you will know when reading this Lewis won. And he won well, I only gave Tyson the 1st Round. I listen to boxing matches without the commentry as I find it annoying. I like to make my own mind up when watching it, after all I paid for the fecking thing, and the commentators will be baised as they are English.</p>
<br /><p>Anyway Lewis won by a knock-out in the eigth grrr.. Well, I was nearly correct, I was just under 2 mins away so I am not feeling that bad about it. :)
<br />I have to say that it was a damn good fight, and my faith in boxing has been re-established. Hopefully Lewis will retire now, I don't think Tyson should get a rematch, he doesn't deserve one. I think Lewis should retire now, he is wealthy enough to do so and he has nothing left to prove.. please don't take a dingy/rubber match Lewis, retire on this one.. please..</p>
<br /><p>I have to say that it was sad to see Tyson get beat. This is the first great boxer get knocked about the ring like a rag doll. It is quite sad to see. I first got interested in boxing in 94 when Lewis was fighting Razor Ruddock to see who would face Riddick Bowe (the man who beat the man who beat the man) - (that man was Mike Tyson btw). Now it has come full circle. Hopefully we will see a new era of boxing emerge now, let the younger guys through.</p>
<br /><p>In fact it has re-established my faith in boxing so much that I just might buy a boxing magazine again (and I haven't done that in a few years).  Also can I just add that Nigel Benn was a good boxer but he sucks at being an expert panel type person. He just can't seem to convey his words correctly and I think he has a chip on his shoulder. He seems to ignore Barry and Nicky (both ex-boxers). He probably thinks that since he was a proper world champion he deserves the spotlight on the panel.. Not so... It doesn't work that way. Anyway he never fought Roy Jones so I don't respect him as a fighter.. And Eubank wasn't even a proper world champion.. WBO my ass.. But that is a different story :)
