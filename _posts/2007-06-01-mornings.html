I don't mind training in the mornings. As long as it is a week day and I am in the mood for it I am fine. I got a txt from the PT at 5:54am this morning to go in. I made it in for 7.30 which is good for me.<br /><br />I pushed myself hard:<br /><br />5mins warm up on the cross trainer levels 8 - 13<br />10mins on the stair master levels 8 - 12. 3mins in the middle taking two steps at a time.<br />25 * 4 @ 40kgs on the stomach cruncher. (more to rest my legs, and my arms were too sore to do weights ;) ).<br />10mins on the treadmill, various levels. speed 8 - 11. incline 0 - 4.5.<br />15mins on the cross trainer - reverse mode on hills level 8 - 15.<br /><br />On reflection I am doing too many rounds on the cross trainer. I should vary it. I think next time I'll warm up on the bike, then the next time warm up on the treadmill and just cut out the cross trainer for the next week.<br /><br />Tomorrow is my off day, and tonight might be my cheat night. I fancy something tasty though. I treat myself once a week, and usually it was on a Sunday but I think I'll do it tonight instead. However as I wont be in the gym on Saturday I wonder how my head will work with having a treat tonight and then not doing anything on Saturday? Granted I might go for 5/9 holes of golf, but that'll be a relaxing thing not a training thing.
