<p>Built under the <a href="http://skillfulgorilla.com">skillful gorilla</a> 
brand RoadClient is an app that enables remote teams in several sectors to
quote for jobs (in their sector), CRM management, invoice raising and marketing.</p>

<p>The solution offers a secure web application that is complemented with a 
mobile app.</p>

<p>The app entered private beta for a period of six months. However it failed
to gain any traction so it was shutdown.</p>
