As much as I *heart* my personal trainer, she's a nutter, a complete nutter. I was pushed hard today, really really hard. At a certain point I thought my heart was gonna bust out of my chest. I didn't reach my goal in weight, but I am not annoyed I know it will come down of its own accord.<br /><br />5min warm up on the cross trainer<br /><br />10mins on manual hills on the treadmill. I didn't find this hard at all. I made the school boy error of saying "That was easier than I thought" - and this is where it went south :)<br /><br />[Circuit]<br />3 * 10 On a platform - one leg squats each leg.<br />3 * 15 Set ups as fast as I can with 9kg dumbbells on each hand each leg.<br />3 * 10 Lunges with 9kg dumbbells each leg.<br /><br />10mins on the cross trainer at level 16 keeping the speed over 16 with the last minute at 17.<br /><br />[Circuit]<br />10 * 3 Pressups<br />10 * 3 Dips<br />10 * 3 @ 18kg overhead tricep extension with free weights.<br /><br />[Circuit]<br />10 * 3 @ 49kg Chest Press<br />10 * 3 Pressups on the stability ball<br />10 * 3 @ 35kg Rear Deltoid machine<br />10 * 3 @ 25kg Chest Press free weight<br /><br />That was it. The first circuit took up a good lot of time. An enjoyable session. My legs were so sore the rest of the day. I went round to a friends house straight after training and was sooo tired. I then woke up at 7am this morning with big ideas of heading to the gym - I tried to get up this morning - ohhhh it just wasn't happening :)<br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-weight:normal;">First rule of gym club:</span> There is no gym club<br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Second rule of gym club:</span> Only a complete fucking idiot tells their personal trainer that something is easy.</blockquote><br /><br />Weight @ 4.30pm - 109kg
