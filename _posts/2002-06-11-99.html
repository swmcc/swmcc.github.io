<h3>Holiday</h3>
<br /><p>My brother is going to Amsterdam in July, and other friends are going to Cyprus, The States, Japan, France, Austrilia and one is even going to South Africa. The 
<br />Bastards :). I <b>will</b> go on holiday this year.. I will I will I will. But where can I go? I fancy going to The States, so I might go there, time will tell.</p>
<br /><p>It suddently dawned on me that I haven't been out of Northern Ireland since 1994 :( Not even down south, why? Fucked if I know :(. I really need to get out of here before I go mad, the furthest I have been since 1994 is three trips to Derry, and even that was work related. I am not one of these narrow minded feckers who wont go outside their own street (these people are a penny a dozen in Northern Ireland), but holy feck - I better do something quick.</p>
