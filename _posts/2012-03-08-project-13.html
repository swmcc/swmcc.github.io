As <a title="Project" href="/personal-tv-project-part-one/">previously</a> discussed I have a personal project. I don't use it much - TV Listings have moved on since it was first written - sky+, tivo, iplayer et all - basically any on demand service has relegated this project to basically useless. However the first incarnation of this project was written back in 2002 so I am not too hard on myself. Then in 2006 I decided to give <a title="XML::Twig" href="http://search.cpan.org/~mirod/XML-Twig-3.39/Twig_pm.slow">XML::Twig</a> a go and <a title="Code" href="https://github.com/swmcc/TV-Listings">rewrote</a> it.</p>

<p>
To be honest I got it up and running at the <a title="Server Crash" href="/2011/01/24/server-crash-of-2011/">start</a> of 2011 and have left running ever since. I just wanted to see if it could sit there and run for about a year without me going anywhere near it. It did :) I really have no use for it and was thinking of shutting it down after I hit the year mark. However I recently started getting into <a title="Ruby on Rails" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and other 'hipster' type languages. My problem though is I need something solid to work on - something to get my teeth into - a real life problem. I've never been good at the 'hello world' type development.</p>

<p>
So after over a year of the machine running I have the following data set to get my teeth into..</p>

<pre>mysql&gt; select count(*) from programme; select count(*) from broadcasts; select count(*) from star; select count(*) from director;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
| 66203 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

<p>It'll be interesting if nothing else. Obviously there are more tables besides these ones like synopsis, categories, channels etc... I pretty much think the channel portion of the project is dead - but there is bound to be something interesting to do with the rest of the data..
