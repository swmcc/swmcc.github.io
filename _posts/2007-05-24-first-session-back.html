Well the first session back went without much drama. It turns out that I lost 4lb in the two weeks I was absent. However I think that was mostly fluid. I will probably gain a few of those pounds back. Which is a shame, but it is only a number. I was mostly concerned with how fit I was.<br /><br />The PT done me good. She didn't push me that hard, but hard enough that I knew I was doing something good. Not too little, not too much - just about right. Well that's what I thought. I started to feel a bit dizzy on the second go on the treadmill and then straight after that I done some mat work. When I got up off the mat I remember thinking to myself "I am gonna be sick" :) I made it okay, was only sick a little bit.<br /><br />I am putting it down as a big shock to the system. After doing nothing for two weeks something had to give. I wonder if I would have went back and done my own thing for a few sessions would it have happened? But to be honest I was glad to get back to it again.<br /><br />I'll head back on Saturday and Sunday. I'll work my way back to the way I was a few weeks ago. Its just nice to be back.<br /><br />This training session went:<br /><br />5 mins on the cross trainer to warm up.<br />mat work +  some circuts.<br />19 mins on the treadmill - speed 8 (just a nice jog) no incline.<br />15kg seated row * 3 sets.<br />35kg curl * 3 sets.<br />10 mins on the treadmill - speed 8 (just a nice jog) 2 incline.<br />mat work.<br /><br />All in all a massive step back, but at least I am getting back into the shape of things. I just have to tell myself that I am still pretty sick. I hope to be back to full strength by next week and back to a full training schedule by Wednesday.  I am not depressed about how far I have fallen back. I am probably at about 25% of what I should be.  I am on my way back though. Just gotta keep thinking that.<br /><br />I find the mat work very hard, but that's a good thing. When I am not with the PT I usually have the following schedule:<br /><br />Monday morning: Heavy cardio - machine weights between each cardio machine.<br />Tuesday evening: Heavy weights  (week about free and machines)<br />Wednesday morning: Moderate cardio - machine weights between each cardio machine.<br />Thursday evening: PT time.<br />Friday morning: Road work, some free weights before the run.<br />Saturday: Off<br />Sunday: Moderate weights (week about free and machines).<br /><br />I vary the machines that I do the cardio on, basically to keep my body used from doing the same thing. I'll tell you something though, being off for two weeks is not much fun, but it'll be a nice wee mini challenge to get back to where I was.
