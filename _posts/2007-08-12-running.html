On Friday late afternoon I went for my weekly 'big' run. This time I hit 5miles, I didn't time myself - I just wanted to finish it. Instead of taking it slow and easy though, I thought it would be better to do the first mile really slow, the second mile really fast and alternate it that way. It worked, by the last leg of the run I was screwed - way more than I should have been. Then this happened:<br /><br />Me brain: Here that girl in the blue t-shirt looks familar.<br />[5 seconds pass]<br />Me brain: Here that girl looks very like the PT.<br />[10 seconds pass]<br />Me brain: Here that is the PT.<br /><br />She was out training too. You can do fuck all in this world without someone finding out. So I gunned it down the last leg and kept on running it until I couldn't run anymore - with a big stitch and my legs crying. I had to walk the last 2mins as I could not possibly run any further. I was impressed. I think on Wednesday morning I'll do that again. However as I gunned it on the last leg the PT passed me on the way to the gym, she was not impressed that I was walking the last bit :)<br /><br />I had a session with her on Sunday morning. Mostly done leg work, sumo squats, kicks, stepping lunges, running up the stairs two at a time with 10kg bells on each arm - that sort of thing. I really hate the machine weights now. Tomorrow I am getting hit hard in the upper body - should be fun :)<br /><br />Oh - going out drinking before a PT session is not fun. I am old enough to know better. Also staying up until 4.30am when the session is at 10:15am is also not good. Luckily I stopped drinking at 1am - but the craic was good so I stayed up.<br /><br />I am going to sleep now as soon as I shove the shopping in. A lazy sunday afternoon - snnnnoooozzzzeeeee..
