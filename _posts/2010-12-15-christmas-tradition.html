Every year I take my Mum into Belfast to do some shopping and buy her lunch. Yesterday we were talking about how long this has been happening and I think it started back ’97 – she says it was before that. I looked in my old blog and here is an entry from<a href="http://bilbo.swm.cc/archives/2005/12/my_day_offski.html" target="_blank"> 2005</a> on it – here is the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/swm/75640223/in/set-1575077/" target="_blank">picture</a> of that dinner.. That year was pretty bad as I was very sick at the time and I remember not feeling up to it. But Christmas is what you make it.. Am glad I went now.

This year I took her to the<a href="http://www.themerchanthotel.com/index.php/dining-at-the-cloth-ear.html" target="_blank"> Cloth Ear</a>, same place as last year. Was lovely. I had a really nice day out and I hope there are many more yet to come. Its nice to do things like this. Below are the three courses – *yum*…
