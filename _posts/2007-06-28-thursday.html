I am very tired, I haven't been able to get to sleep lately.<br /><br />Today would have been my PT session, but she aint here so I am doing my own thang. This is what I done:<br /><br />5mins on the cross trainer - level 9 - 1.23km.<br />3 * 15 @ 56kg on the lateral pulldown<br />3 * 15 @ 40kg on the lateral raise<br />3 * 15 @ 11.75kg on the Pully machine - tricep extension each arm.<br />3 * 15 @ 49kg on the seated row - all three grips used.<br />3 * 15 @ 56kg chest press.<br />3 * 15 @ 42kg butterfly machine.<br />10mins on the bike - level 9 - 15 on hills. Kept the speed at over 110 at all times.<br /><br />Weight at 7pm - 114kg!!! I feel like shite. I knew my diet was bad.
