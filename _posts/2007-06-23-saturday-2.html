I am getting out of the habit of having my 'off' day on a Saturday, I am not sure if I like it or not. My legs are killing me from the PT session yesterday. They really burn and even walking is sore, and it hurts mostly on the inside of my legs - a very weird feeling. So I am refraining from doing any intensive cardio work.<br /><br />I went into the gym at around 2pm, it wasn't that busy which was good.<br /><br />5min @ level 9 on the cross-trainer 1.35km<br />15 * 3 @ 40kg lateral raise<br />12 * 3 @ 49kg Pectoral Fly<br />12 * 3 @ 49kg Chest Press<br />12 * 3 @ 53kg Lateral Pulldown<br />12 * 3 @ 13.75kg each @ Dual Adustuable Pully - Incline Press<br />10 * 3 @ 14kg curl free weight.<br /><br />5 mins stairmaster:<ul><li> 2mins level 9</li><li> 1.15min level 10</li><li> 1.15min level 11</li><li> 0.45sec level 7</li></ul><br />Total time just under an hour. I was going to do more on the stairmaster, but I know that my legs need time to rest. I was quite happy with the workout, but I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow, so I might not make it. I done 5 holes of golf too, I wanted to do 9 but my legs were screaming.<br /><br />Weight @ 2pm - 111.6
