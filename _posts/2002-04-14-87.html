<h3>Okay</span></h3><p>Okay...<br>So I have changed templates but not sure about this one, I'll give it time and see what happens. It might grow on and then again it might not, time will tell and all that.</p>
<br /><p> So I am sitting here with a pretty big hangover feeling sorry for myself :) Well I am not really feeling sorry myself at all. I had a really good time and stuff. I have really good friends that I take for granted most of the time, but it became apparent how much they mean to me this weekend. I am a lucky sort of a fella to have friends like that. Shane baked me and Ruthie a cake which was nice - he really should start up his own bakery ;). Bah sentimental bullshit I hate it. However this blog thing is for things like that.</p><p>For people that know me they should know that I have a diary/journal thing on my <a href="http://swmcc.com">webshite</a> but I think this is different than just a journal or diary. I think that it is to be used to put down your thoughts there and then and not be edit at anytime in the future. Well that is what I am going to use it for.</p>
<br /><p>Anyway I am away to get some sleep now, and maybe the hangover will be gone by the time I get back?</p>
