Okay.. It is snowing today which is fine and dandy. However if you are a townie driver please do not go out in it. If you can't handle the fact that you can't see the white line in the road then please don't get in your car and please use the bus. I was coming in to work today, as I go over the Hannastown Rd (Black Mountain) the snow was pretty deep. I got stuck in front of this asshole who never went above 10mph. Now I am not hot headed nor stupid enough to pass him on that road but the 4 cars behind me passed me and him at stupid places. Yes they shouldn't have passed on that road at anytime never mind the fact that it was snowing, but I think that they were pissed off with going at 10mph which I can understand. There was no need for the driver to go at 10mph no need at all, he was in a better car than mine for feck sake. It was stupid and that is how accidents happen - a good speed in that level of snow would have been 20-30-mph not 10mph. So please if you are scared of the snow please do the following:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Don't go up or down the Hannastown (or any mountain road for that matter)</li>
<li>Keep in a high gear if possible</li>
<li>Put your feckin lights on</li>
<li>Travel at a resonable speed</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Okay Rant over..
