I feel let down by <a href="http://www.translink.co.uk">Translink</a>. I can think of two instances in the last year that I defended them.. And this morning they let me down by lying to my face about a bus that I was supposed to catch. Idiots.</p>

<p>
The first time I stood up for them was last year sometime when Translink launched their new site. The response to it was rather lackluster to say the least. They won some <a href="http://www.episerver.com/en/News/Press/EPiServer-announces-2010-Award-Winners/">award</a> for it - which to be honest I didn't think was deserved - but there you go that's life.</p>

<p>
The thing I really didn't like about it though wasn't to do with the site itself - it was the amount of 'cyber bullying' that went on twitter when it went live. It had some serious flaws in it - especially the <a href="http://www.translink.co.uk/Journey-Planner/">Journey Planner.</a> It still isn't great, but it works most of the time.</p>

<p>
I thought the people that jumped on the bandwagon and started to slag it off was pretty disturbing. Of course you got the usual social media dahhhlings giving examples of failed search criteria etc - I wasn't too surprised about them - a few others I was - but again that's life. To be honest 90% of the people that I did see that complain I don't really rate very highly at all. The usual self promoting assholes that think that social media is a new science. Pathetic. The other group were people (in my humble opinon) that haven't written any software worthwhile either - the type that think that getting a webscript using the Twitter API is high end stuff or writing an iPhone app is cutting edge... Anyway am getting off point here :)</p>

<p>
The second time was during the really bad winter weather NI had back in mid December. I thought Translink were dead on in saying that they couldn't drive in some places. The roads were awful and with the amount of claim culture going on I thought it made sense that they shut everything down.</p>

<p>
This morning though I had to get the bus - obviously the bus came early and just left. I always get to my stop 10mins before the bus is due.. I rang them a few times and each time I got a differing story. So I sent them a letter. So I will see what happens.. I want someone to get back to me! I defended you twice Translink - don't let me down!</p>
<pre>Dear Sir/Madam,

I have to admit I am an infrequent user of your company. However due to circumstances I have had to use Translink at least 10-12 times in the last 4-6 weeks and I have to say your service really does need stepping up a bit. Today I waited 1hour 20mins for a bus on a route that is supposed to have a bus on the hour every hour.

If I was the only person waiting for the bus then I would have put this down to me just being stupid but another five people were waiting for the bus with me. I was there ten mins early at 08:05 but obviously the bus came early and didn't wait. We rang the office depot and they said there was an accident that stopped the bus from going out - this differed from the first explanation we got which was down to 'major roadworks'. The 109a coming back from Lisburn -&gt; Antrim shuttled passed our stop at 08:55 - which according to the frequent passengers I was waiting with is the same bus that was supposed to pick us up at 8:15.

Can you please tell me at what time the 109a bus got into Glenavy at - I am sure your buses have some time recording equipment on them? This would be the bus that left Antrim at 07:45. And what was exactly the cause of the delay? I heard from two differing accounts from your members of staff - one said road works and the other said an accident. I think the bus was just early and left without waiting - which isn't really good enough.

Also when I am here I would like to complain about another point. Your bus drivers don't know how to do transfers. I have to get into Hillsborough from Glenavy and I am sure it would be so much cheaper if I could just say to the driver my actual end point. Instead though I have to get a full single (or return - but lets just use single for ease) from Glenavy to Lisburn then another full single from Lisburn to Hillsborough. Total price £10.10 a day! That is over £50 to get 15mile up the road. I haven't a clue what kind of fuel you are using on your buses - but it sure isn't ordinary diesel. However this rather petty of me to be honest and a fairly minor gripe. I wouldn't mind paying the fare if you could actually make your buses come in on time and give us reliable information.

If you need help in looking up the time table for the 109A bus - you can get it here - <a href="http://www.translink.co.uk/Timetables/Ulsterbus-Timetables/Ulsterbus-Service-109A-Outbound/" target="_blank">http://www.translink.co.uk/Timetables/Ulsterbus-Timetables/Ulsterbus-Service-109A-Outbound/</a>

I look forward to your reply.

Yours faithfully,

Stephen McCullough</pre>
