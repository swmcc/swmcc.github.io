I said <a href="../2010/11/26/so-far-so-not-bad/" target="_blank">before</a> that I wanted to install <a href="http://irssi.org/" target="_blank">irssi </a>on my VM. Well I did <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /> I don’t know whether I am getting used to <a href="http://www.centos.org/" target="_blank">Centos</a> or my prejudice against it was so strong at the start that when I do get into it and have to do stuff, I find out that its not really that big a deal. I don’t know. Still prefer <a href="http://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">debian</a> though <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />

Anyway I want to use irssi to chat on some rooms I partake in that don’t really exist (#cabal) and have it under a <a href="http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen" target="_blank">screen</a> session so I can see what was said before I got into work and then join in without asking to be caught up on the goings on.

In work I use <a href="http://colloquy.info/" target="_blank">colloquy</a> which is a very pretty IRC client, but its annoying. When someone says my name on it – it bounces on the dock. Now I know there is probably a way to get that to stop in the prefs, but I don’t want that. When it comes to work I want to know that someone is looking me. For #cabal type stuff though it can wait.

Installing it on Centos wasn’t a pain – and here it is for anyone that might want to do it in the future.

That’s it.
