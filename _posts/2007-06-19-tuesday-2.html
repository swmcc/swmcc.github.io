Went on a Tuesday afternoon. I intended to go in the morning but when I woke up I couldn't summon the energy needed to get out of my pit.<br /><br />I was in the gym and warming up at 6pm on the cross trainer. I held speeds of 15/16 at level 9 and managed 0.8mile. I then done some weights followed by a quick oul go on the cross trainer. It wasn't a heavy session or anything, just enough to keep me going. To be honest I could have done without going, but I done my hour and went home.<br /><br />5mins on the cross trainer - level 9 - 0.8miles.<br />10 * 4 @ 42kg on the lateral raise.<br />15 * 4 @ 42kg on the butterfly machine.<br />15 * 4 @ 35kg on the bicep curl machine.<br />15 * 4 @ 40kg on the stomach cruncher.<br />15 * 3 @ 49kg on the lateral pull down. (I didn't get 4 down as a PT wanted it).<br />10mins on the cross trainer levels 9 - 16 on reverse mode speeds of 15/16.<br /><br />After I was finished the cross trainer I wanted to go and finish my last set on the lateral pull down and do 4 sets on the chest press, but the place was too busy and those machines were being used, and I couldn't be assed waiting so I went home :)<br /><br />Was quite happy with everything, went for 2 mile walk at 9pm to stretch out my legs.<br /><br />Weight @ 6pm: 112.8kg
