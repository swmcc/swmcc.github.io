Hi, my name is Stevie and this is my training blog.<br /><br />So far this year I have managed to lose just under 4 stone (56pounds) through sensible eating and training at the gym. And I have to say it has been really really enjoyable.<br /><br />I don't intend for this blog to be a 'do what I do' thing. I don't intend it to be an inspiration to others. It is just simply a way for me to keep track of my weight loss and training.<br /><br />I will add more details later. But hopefully this is the start of many posts and I can look back this time 6 months and see a good change. As this is only the start.
