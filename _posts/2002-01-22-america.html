Moffett is going to America.. the bastard. I was thinking about this and I haven't been on a holiday since 1994.. The most days I have had off from work (not counting weekends) was when I was made redundant @ BlackStar (15 days off - not counting weekends). I really need a holiday - or at least I need to get out of this country for a while, I've only took two days holiday from my current work - so if you have any ideas then give me shout.
