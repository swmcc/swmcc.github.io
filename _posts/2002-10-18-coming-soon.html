<h1>Coming Soon</h1>


<p>SWMcc.com v.2.2</p>
<p>
There was a minor release that I never made public. But it was a release. I have decided to use more css. In fact I hope this is the release that I get rid of formatting in my html at all.
</p>

<p>
It looks completly different than the current version but it wont be as big a deal as the last upgrade from v1.1 to v2.0.
</p>

<p>
The major additions are:
<br /><br />
It will allow me to log on to the site (and a few others). This is mainly due to me getting pissed off with having two copies. One on my main site and another on another on a sub domain. If I make changes I only want to see them. There is no point in having multiple files all over the darn place
Should be fully XHTML complaint, and not a mish mash of crap like it currently is
No JavaScript. It was a nice idea, but I don't think it was necessary. I plan to git rid of it entirely
New interface. I don't like the way this currently looks, it is plain and boring
