Apparently Wee Moffett (Claire) hasn't washed herself since Saturday (it is now Thursday!!!!!). What a minger :) For those that know Claire this will come as quite a suprise... I'm quite proud of her. I must post a picture of her as she isn't the sort of girl that reminds you of a stinker!! Will post one up soon...
