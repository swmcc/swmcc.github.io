Grrrrrr. Went to the gym at 5.30 to find out that they had a power cut and that they wouldn't allow us access to the changing rooms. I could have queued up to use the toilets to get changed but there were too many people there. I decided to head home and just rest for the night.<br /><br />I done my usual two mile walk at night, but now that the leg is better its more of a relaxing thing than an actual training thing now.<br /><br />Was really pissed off about the power cut thing. I really wanted to try for an hour to see where I was. I also wanted to weigh myself to see where I was. I have been losing a good bit recently and just wanted to know if it was still coming off. I hate not knowing, especially since I meet the PT tomorrow.
