<h3>Where you been @?</h3>
<br /><p>No excuses, I am just lazy :)</p>
<br /><p>I ordered a book on Amazon.co.uk and the order took over 24hours to get shipped. Not exactly great service IMHO, but not bad either. Either way I should have it for Monday, I would have liked it for the weekend but it was my fault, you shouldn't order stuff near the end of the week. Ahh well.</p>
<br /><p>I think I will change this template as well, it sucks ;)</p>
