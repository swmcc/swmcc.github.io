Well I got to the spinning class a bit late. My porridge wouldn't cool down, and I knew I had to eat something before hand or I would end up on the floor :) I didn't leave the house until 6.30am - was in for 6:50, changed and in the studio for 6:55, biked set up for 6:58 and on it for 7am :) I never want it to be that tight again.<br /><br />There was no PT this time, she didn't turn up - so I have the moral high ground - unless she has a good excuse for not turning up. But until I find out the reason I will bask in my superior "I was in and you weren'tness" :)<br /><br />The person who usually takes the class was on holiday, so a new fella took it. The PT told me to expect it to be a lot harder, and boy it was. More hills on this one and I shoved the resistance but more than I probably should have. But I kept up with most of it. My legs are burning my ass is sore and you know what - I foopin love it :)<br /><br />My weight was down a good bit too :)
