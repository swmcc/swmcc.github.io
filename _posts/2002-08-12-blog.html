So, Marc wants me to meld my blog and my journal into one. And I say No. I like the way it is now, my journal is a record of what I am doing, going to do and stuff. My blog on the other hand is a collection of my thoughts (which are normally rants). However to make his life easier I will set up a feed for him. Yes.. I will do that soon.</p>
