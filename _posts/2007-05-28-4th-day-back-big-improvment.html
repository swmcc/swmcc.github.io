Well today was my fourth time back, and I am glad to report that it was a big improvement from the last three sessions. I still only done 45mins/50mins, I don't want to damage my leg before it is better.<br /><br />I managed to do 10mins on the treadmill at an incline of 2 at speeds from 9 to 11 for 10mins. Still nowhere near as good as it was but a markable step up from the last three sessions. Various free weights, a cycle and a go on the cross trainer.<br /><br />I am heading tomorrow morning so I'll start doing my proper routine then. Am glad to be getting back to it. I also doen 5 holes of golf today and am quite tired now.<br /><br />5 mins on the cross trainer levels 8 - 12 for a warm up.<br />Various free weights for 15mins.<br />Incline bench press - 15 * 3 @ 13.85kgs.<br />Machine curl  - 15 * 3  @ 35kgs.<br />10mins on the treadmill  - incline 2  - levels 9  - 11.<br />10mins on the  bike - hill - 8 - 15.<br />10mins on the crosstrainer - random - 8 - 14 - reverse mode.<br /><br />Tomorrow morning I will try the horrible stairmaster - my nemisis. Boy I hate that exercise.<br /><br />I also lost the pound I gained yesterday, which was a nice suprise. My diet has been okay, not great but okay. Tomorrow it all starts properly again, thank crunchie.
