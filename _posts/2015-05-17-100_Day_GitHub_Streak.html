<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I got to day 100 of my <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> <a href="https://github.com/swmcc?tab=contributions&from=2015-02-08&to=2015-05-13">streak</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2015/03/24/50_Day_GitHub_Streak.html">Here</a> is the background on this whole thang.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Instead of explaining my findings I went and created a web page to summarise the information. <a href="http://www.theonlystephen.com/github-100day-commits/">Here</a> it is. I am too
embarrassed to show the code that worked this stuff out. It might turn out to be a nice project though.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I am happy enough with the pull requests and in the next 50 days I would like to have a several more.</p>
<p>I did find out that I was adding too many one line changes to my <a href="https://github.com/swmcc/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> repo. I wanted to learn more during this challenge and adding a one line change to 'runcom' file isn't
what I think is useful. To counter this I created a new <a href="https://github.com/swmcc/stuffilearned">Stuff I learned</a> repo.</p>  
<p>I created 83 issues and by the 100 day mark 54 of them were closed. I am happy enough with this.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/swmcc/exercises">exercies</a> repo I created has been a failure. This tells me that unless I have a practical application I have little to no interest. This is something I should change.</p>
<p>I want to see more pull requests and for me to finally start doing something useful with the <a href="https://github.com/swmcc/api.whatisonthe.tv">api.whatisonthe.tv</a> repo as it has been ignored for the last month (at the time of writing).</p>
