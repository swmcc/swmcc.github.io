Update:<br />
So, gandalf's (this machine) IP address has changed. I had to take down the sites over the weekend, but still if you knew the new IP you could have seen the site. But then again, how would you know :) So everything is back up and running again, and I got a nice new shiny IP :)

On another note my car passed the MOT this morning. Yay :) :) I am happy. So now all I have to do is do one or minor thangs with her (cosmetic stuff) and then I can sell her and get a nicer car
