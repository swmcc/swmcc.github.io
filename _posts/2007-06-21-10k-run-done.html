I done the 10k (6 mile) run. My time was 1:10 - which while not at all fast is a pretty good achievement if you consider that I couldn't run for 2mins on the treadmill in January.<br /><br />I ran the first 3 mile without stopping, then my right knee started to lock up a bit so I had to stop and walk it out. Then my legs started to ache a bit and had to stop again and then from there I started to feel sick in the last leg and had to stop and walk again. If I hadn't have stopped I am sure I could have done it within the hour.<br /><br />The next 10k race is in Belfast in September so I am doing that, and gonna see if I can get under the hour, which I should be.<br /><br />Today isn't a PT day so am gonna take it as on 'off' day, the PT day is tomorrow instead.
