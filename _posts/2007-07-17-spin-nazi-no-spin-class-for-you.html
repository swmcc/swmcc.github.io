The spin class was full tonight. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr. But it is a very popular class and it was to be expected. I felt sorry for Christina though, and not only for not having a class as she was looking forward to it. But one of the regular members was quite nasty to her regarding not getting a bike. Now she's old enough now (22) to stick up for herself, but I will always be her big bro and I don't like people having a go at her in front of me. I think Christina was a bit taken aback, so I hope it doesn't put her off going to any other classes. Time will tell I suppose.<br /><br />As the class was cancelled I decided to do a very heavy cardio workout. I went on the bike for 25minutes and I never went below 100, even towards the end and my legs now feel the pain. Then it was on the treadmill, cross-trainer and finally the stair master.<br /><br />20 mins on the bike levels 10 - 16 on hills. 14.2km - boy did that hurt.<br />10 mins on the treadmill level 9 speed 10 - boy did that hurt too :)<br />10 mins on the cross trainer levels 9 - 12 on hills - can't remember the distance.<br />10 mins on the stair master level 10 .<br />12 * 3 @ 56kg on the seated row - all three grips.<br />5 mins on the treadmill level 10 - with 1 min sprint at level 13.<br /><br />A very good session I think. Spin class the marra morning though, should be fun.
