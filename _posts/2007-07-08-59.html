I took Saturday off, mainly cos I just wanted to chill out and I needed the break to sort me head out and stuffs :) I did go for five holes of golf though.<br /><br />Today I done mostly weights. I don't want to do any cardio, as I am gonna be doing cardio pretty much exclusively (apart from the PT day) this coming week.<br /><br />5min warm up on the bike at level 9.<br />15 * 3 @ 56kg on the chest press<br />15 * 3 @ 13.5kg each - incline press - pully machine.<br />15 * 3 @ 40kg - tricep extension<br />15 * 3 @ 56kg on the seated row - each three grips.<br />15 * 3 @ 22.5kg seated chest press<br />10 * 3 @ 14kg bicep curl<br />10mins on the cross trainer:<br /><br /><ul><li>5mins level 9 </li><li>1mins level 12</li><li>3mins level 8 taken two at a time</li><li>1min level 9 taken two at a time</li></ul>A pretty good workout I think. I expect to be sore tomorrow. Hopefully will be going for some golf later on today as well.<br /><br />Weight @ 1pm - 110.9
