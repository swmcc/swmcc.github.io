<h3>Hotheaded Drivers</h3>
<br /><p>I hate hotheaded drivers. Now my Father is a lorry driver so I come from good stock as regards <b>Road Rage</b>. I get RR everytime I am in the car, but I usually just curse the person in and out of hell, I never beep my horn or do anything like that - there is no point. I would regard myself as a careful driver, yes I make mistakes, yes I do speed sometimes (or as much as you can in a 1.2 Corsa).<p>
<br /><p>Anyway in my way to work this morning I got stuck behind an articulated Lorry... grrrrrr. The road I met this lorry on only allows you to overtake on certain parts and even then you have to be careful as the road is very rocky. If you look at the road you can see that it dips at either side, and if you are driving a lorry you get pulled in due to these dips. So anyway I was driving behind this lorry knowing full well I would have to wait until we got to the Dundrod Raceway to overtake the lorry as the current road I was on
<br />wouldn't allow me to do it safely. But this hot headed prick behind me decided to overtake, which was really stupid. The lorry driver seen him and had to move even further into the left hand side of the road, which pulled him in, he had no choice but to move out or else he would have went into a couple of trees. The car then froze and just stopped in the middle of the road, as he seen the lorry getting closer to him, and then another car came in the opposite direction - fuck me was it fun. Luckily nothing bad happened, but it wasn't through lack of trying on the car drivers part. What a Wanker.</p>
<br /><p>Hot headed pricks shouldn't drive on country roads... And they should look at the state of the road before overtaking... grrrr</p>
