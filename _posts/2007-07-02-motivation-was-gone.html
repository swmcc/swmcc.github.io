Well last week was a rather nasty week for me. I lost my motivation for the gym, which was weird, but I suppose after a good run of almost 6 months that it had to happen at some time. The PT was away on holiday so I knew I wasn't going to get weighed at the end of the week, this added with work, personal issues and family crap meant that I just burnt out. I like to think that is what happened anyway.<br /><br />My weight went up to 114 on Friday!! So I got my act back together on Saturday and went to the gym, done some golf and started running again. I weighed myself today and am a good bit lower than I was when the PT last weighed me. So that's all good - to a point. The fact that I fell off the wagon is a bit nasty, if the PT was there I doubt it would have happened. I would like to be stronger than that, but I am not, I suppose that's how I got myself into the state I was/am in.<br /><br />Well, anyway after a week of fucking around I am back on track again, and that is the main thing.<br /><br />I didn't go to the gym on Sunday, I slept 13.5hours that day and boy did I need it. I went to spin class on Monday - I kept up the whole time I think and I am now setting the gears harder and pushing myself further.<br /><br />Weight @ 8am - 111.5kg
