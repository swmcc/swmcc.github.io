It has been at least five years since I had an actual homepage. During this time the domain has been dormant or it has pointed to a third party site -Â <a title="About Me" href="http://about.me">about.me</a> or a <a title="Google Profile " href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Account">google profile</a>.</p>

<p>
It seems the current trend is to have one page that explains all so I went down that route. I have little to no interest in creating web pages/sites - I bitch and moan about it if I have to do it in work so there was no way I was going to waste time creating one from scratch on my own time. Especially on a mundane home page site. So with that I decided on using a HTML and CSS template made by <a title="Tom Kenny" href="https://twitter.com/#!/tkenny" target="_blank">Tom Kenny</a>. I also put on a tag cloud of the technologies I use or have used. I think this represents a better way to get that information than a list. I used <a title="Tag Crowd" href="http://tagcrowd.com/" target="_blank">Tag Cloud</a> for that and it just worked.

The site doesn't do much and there isn't really much else I can do with it. It links to the various sites I use and after that there isn't much else I can really say.

The site doesn't look that good in IE8 - but I could care less. Tom did a great job on the CSS and I am very happy with the results.
