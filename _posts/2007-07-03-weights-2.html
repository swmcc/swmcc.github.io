I done a lot of cardio these past few days, so I decided to do some weights today instead. I usually like going on a Tuesday later afternoon straight after work, but I wanted to get this out of the way and hopefully go for some golf later on.<br /><br />I am feeling a lot better than I did last week, so I am putting it down to personal and work crap.<br /><br />5mins on the cross trainer at level 9 - 1.1km<br />3 * 15 @ 40kg on the lateral raise.<br />3 * 15 @ 56kg on the lateral pulldown - wide grip<br />2 * 25 @ 40kg on the stomach cruncher<br />3 * 15 @ 30kg on the lateral pulldown  - narrow grip<br />3 * 15 @ 17.5kg seated shoulder press - free weight<br />3 * 12 @ 56kg on the seated row - all three grips<br /><br />I was going to do 10mins on the cross trainer but my legs were a bit tired. I will go for a run tonight I think, and hopefully get 5holes of golf in if the weather lets me :)<br /><br />Weight @ 8am - 110.9kg
