So, went to the spinning class this morning. The PT didnae turn up again :) Today was a bit weird, I am getting a bit bored with the music as its been the same the last three classes now. I would like a bit of variety, so far the class goes like this:<br /><br />8 Songs - two of which are warm up tracks:<br /><br />1. 3 rounds of riding easy and sprints, medium pace.<br />2. 3 rounds of riding easy, sprints and a few hills, medium to hard pace.<br />3. 4 rounds of sprints, 1 recovery between round 3 &amp; 4 - hard pace.<br />4. 5 rounds of hill sprints and climbing fast pace.<br />5. 4 rounds of sprints with the last round being a mixture of climbs for 10secs - hard pace.<br />6. 4 rounds of hill sprints.<br />7. 3 rounds of sprints with the 3rd round being really foopin long.<br />8. Mountain climb, with no relief on the gears one recovery - very hard pace.<br /><br /><br />For the first time I think I kept up with most of it, and I noticed that when I had to release the gears at the end of the songs I had to take three or four turns :) I feel pretty good at the minute. I intend to go for 5 rounds of golf tonight as well and fit in another 3mile run.<br /><br />Weight @ 8am: 112.2kg
