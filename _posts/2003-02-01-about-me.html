If I had to tell you what I'm like in real life, I'd lie. If you insisted I do it properly, I'd make a joke about it, and hopefully we'd both laugh and forget about it. Which basically means I'm not going to pour out everything on this shitty screen. If you want to know me use email and I will reply.</p>

I live with my brother John. I also have and one sister, Christina. My brother John is aged 24 and is a session player (piano). My sister Christina is 20. She is in her second year of nursing at the time of writing. My Dad (he wouldn't want me to give his age out) is called Edmund and looks really like my younger brother, really it is very scary its like they shit each other :) anyway he has his own Haulage firm. My mother Isobel (again no age) works as a home tutor to kids in a variety of subjects. She used to teach however she got pissed off teaching little bastards that sued you for looking at them the wrong way.</p>

<p>
I don't have that many hobbies however I like good drama like the West Wing & The Sopranos. SCI-FI is something that I finding less and less time for as most of it is crap. I was never a Star Trek fan the only SCI-FI show that has been any use of late is Babylon 5, maybe I'm getting old or something.</p>

I like developing and mainting websites I suppose it is the inner geek in me. I like taking a blank peice of paper (or screen) typing some letters into and it and then letting someone use what is generated from it. Most of my family are musical or creative in some way I was never blessed in that way so the closet thing I get to being creative is designing systems.</p>

<p>
I work at Sendit.com which I really like. The ppl are great and it doesn't even feel like a job. My role is as a sort of head tea making boy and cheif sandwich getter. Now and again I get to some programming which I love. The fellas I work with are great, apart from Duggie who I hate.
