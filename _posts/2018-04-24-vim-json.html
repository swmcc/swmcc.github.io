<p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.twitter.com/holsee">Holsee</a> introduced me to a new command line tool <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. Prior to this I formatted json given to me in a variety of ways. Sometimes using python, another time I would use a web formatter and I have even been known, on ocassion to go into a REPL.  There was never a defacto way of formatting JSON for me... Until now...</p>
<p>It has only been a way a few hours since using it but already I know it will stay with me for a good
while. So much so that I already elvated into my workflow in <a href="https://github.com/swmcc/dotfiles/commit/063ed07cec57d99a78f3183480eca641a84d772e#diff-4570ec26583846b94776a725fdc415cdR97">vim</a>.</p>

<p>
<pre>
map ,j :%!jq '.'<cr>
</pre>
<br /><br />
</p>
<p>What this simply means that I highlight the json I want formatted and type in <pre>,j</pre> and its nicely formatted. As stated before in my <a href="/vim">workflow</a> I like to stay inside the browser.<p>
<p>Here is an example of a script with some unformattted json.</p>

<p>Simply selected the line with <pre>shift + v</pre>and then hit <pre>,j</pre> and...</p>

<p>On the command line it can be very useful... I am looking forward to using this more and more in the coming months!</p>
