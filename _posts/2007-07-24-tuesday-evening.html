Well since Monday was such a washout I decided to push myself hard. I need to get my weight down. I just have to. It is killing me. I weighed myself this afternoon.. Ohhhh noooo!!! What a bad idea. But sure, it was a fun weekend :)<br />I am that ashamed of myself I aint putting it on here, lets just say it isn't good.<br /><br />A quick warm up on the cross trainer, some weights - but not much. And mostly cardio.<br /><br />5 minutes on the cross trainer at level 9 - 1.32km<br />10 * 3 @ 56kg Chest Press<br />10 * 3 @ 49kg Butterfly machine<br />15 * 3 @ 40kg Tricep Extension<br />15minutes on the treadmill at level 9 - incline 1.5<br />15minutes on the stair master:<br /><ul><li>10 minutes on level 10</li><li>5minutes level 9 taken two at a time</li></ul>15minutes on the cross trainer on hills - reverse mode level 9 - 16.<br />10minutes on the bike level 9 (I just took this one easy as I am going to spin tomorrow morning).<br /><br />I am quite pleased. The weights I do now aren't that heavy. In saying that they are machine weights, which I am starting to feel quite ashamed about. I really should move on to free weights and just ignore those damn machines.
