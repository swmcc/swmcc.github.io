Well I am back after what seems like a lifetime :)<br /><br />On Thursday the PT killed my legs. On Friday I woke up with the intention of going to the gym, but my legs just said "No.. No.. No..". I then took Friday as an off day. I woke up on Saturday morning with the same intention but my legs just said "Fuck No.. Fuck No.. Fuck No..". I texted the PT to tell her that she had broken me, I got the following dry reply:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">"It is a good pain. Don't worry :)"</span><br /><br />The smiley face made me laugh. Of course I read in PT subtitles the following:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">"Fuck up, stop being a pussy and don't annoy me with this trivial nonsense".</span><br /><br />Then on Saturday afternoon I got a phone call from a friend who has been in the states for the past two months. Long story short - a 12 hour drinking binge, a house party in some ghetto in Belfast and the worst hang over since D-Day hit me. I ended up walking up the Lisburn Rd at 6am on Sunday morning and not rising until 9pm on Sunday night. I aint that young anymore - my body can't recover like it did. Although I feel better than I have done in years I was just stupid :) Monday was a wasted day. I thought I'd head in at 8pm to do a session, I stuck it for all of 10 minutes :) I haven't weighed myself since Thursday, I know I done myself a load of damage this weekend.. And you wanna know what..<br /><br />I'd do it all again the marra :)
