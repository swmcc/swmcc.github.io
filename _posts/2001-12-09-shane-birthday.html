I had such a good night last night.. Shane had his surprise 21st birthday party last night and it was great. Too much alcohol consumed but sure I am young (I am you know, I am!!).

Honestly I had a really good time and I can't remember who won this time me or Shane, but since it was his birthday I will let this one go.. However the new year is coming up so this will be the decider... Happy birthday Shane, you little bastard ;)
