I feel like shit at the minute :( I really, really do. I have a sore throat and actually took a day of work (which is a really rare event for me[0]. Anyway now that I am off I might get SWMcc::Visitor working so that I can start to cookie check this site as my access_log is getting filled up with code_red requests making it harder for me to see what is being looked at and stuff.</p>

[0] So if anyone from ILM is reading this, I am a really hard worker and I hardly ever take days off work, even for holidays!!!!!!!!
