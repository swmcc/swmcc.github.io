Usually Saturday would be my off day, but yesterday I was forced to have it. It felt weird going in on a Saturday. I woke up in the morning and decided to go for a 2 mile run. This is the same path that I walk at night to calm myself before I go to bed. I didn't time myself, and by the time I was running at 10.30pm it must have been about 18'C. I found it okay to do, but running in that heat is just wrong.<br /><br />I went to the gym at about 3pm. Usually you get the body building loons in on a Saturday, but there weren't that many today. I started off with a 5min warmup on the crosstrainer at level 8. I have decided that I want to do at least 1km in that 5min time period. It can be easily done, and is a sufficent warm up. I didn't want to do too much cardio stuff today, mostly weights.<br /><br />5mins @ level 8 - cross trainer (1.1km)<br />10 * 3 @ 15kg Bicep curl - free weights.<br />10 * 3 @ 30kg Bicep curl - machine weight.<br />10 * 3 @ 42kg Lateral raise -  machine weight.<br />10 * 3 @ 50kg  Tricep machine that stays beside the Lateral Raise.<br />10mins on the stairmaster - various levels from 8 - 12. 2mins at level 8 taken two at a time.<br />25 * 4 @ 40kg stomach crunch (that is gonna hoit.. I can feel it).<br /><br />That was it. Was only 45mins, but I thought with the run this morning it was adequate. I also weight myself, am down about .75kg from Thursday, and as it was in the afternoon I think it was an accurate measurement :)<br /><br />Looking foward to tomorrow.
