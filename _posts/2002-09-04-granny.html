My Granny would have been 90 today had she lived. She died on the 12th January 1998. That is over four and a half years ago. She was 85 but for some reason I still think that she had a lot more of her life to live. She seemed to go before her time. I really think the world of my grandmother and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of her.</p>

My Granny lived with us until she died, she has had made a profound impact on my life (as well as my brother and sister). There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of her.
