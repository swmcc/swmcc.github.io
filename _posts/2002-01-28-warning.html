Never every drink coffee (especailly espresso) before going to see a three hour film! I went to see Harry Potter with Ruthie yesterday, I got all figity during the film. The film wasn't bad. But I will never again drink coffee before I go to see a film. Most of you are sensible and wouldn't think of doing such a thing, but I am thick! :)
