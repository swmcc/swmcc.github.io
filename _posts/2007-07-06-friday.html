Seems that I may be getting back to a sort of normal routine. However instead of going running during the evening after work I done it in the morning. After work I went to the gym and done more weights. It was nice to get some normality back after the last few weeks.<br /><br />5 min warm up on the crosstrainer level 9 - 1.3km<br />3 *15 @ 40kg over head tricep extension on the pully machine<br />3 * 15 @ 56kg on the chest press<br />3 * 15 @ 56kg on the lateral pulldown wide grip<br />10mins on the stair master:<br /><ul><li>5 mins on level 9</li><li>1 min at level 12</li><li>3 mins at level 8 taken two at a time</li><li>1 min at level 9 taken two at a time</li></ul>3 * 15 @ 17.5 seated shoulder press free weight.<br /><br />I am going into the gym on Saturday and Sunday so I decided to take it easier than I normally would have. And with the two mile run this morning I didn't want to do any more cardio as I wanted to do a bigger run on Saturday.<br /><br />Weight @ 6pm - 110.2kg :)
