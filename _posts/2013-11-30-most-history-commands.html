<p>Well I pulled this out of the archives. I've tried looking for past versions of this but I must have just looked at them and never blogged. Pity as it would have been nice to see what I was doing x years ago. So I'll save it here for a future of me to see.</p>

<p>The biggest surprise was the abscence of ssh. In saying that I think tmux has pretty much nullified that. Also I've started to use <a href="http://heroku.com/">heroku</a> lately. Also quite suspicious in its abscene was any database shell commands. Again I am sure tmux and my start_development script has taken away the need for me to explicitly go into a db shell. Quite proud that grunt is in there - I've really started to use that for my web dev tasks lately.</p>
<p>All in all I am pretty happy with all that.</p>
