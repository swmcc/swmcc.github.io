<p>This was a project done under <a href="http://www.missioniq.com">MissionIQ</a>.
<p><a href="http://www.haigclub.com/">Haig Club</a> in conjunction with 
David Beckham launched a whiskey drink.</p>
<p>All the digital assets to be consumed by the media agencies were to go through
several screen processes with every party (haig, 19 management, diageo, smartbrand,
legal) having to contribute to every video, picture and document. Then when an asset
or collection was approved then the assets were shared with the public.</p>
<p>As a core member of this team (of three) - we provided a solution written using
django.</p>
