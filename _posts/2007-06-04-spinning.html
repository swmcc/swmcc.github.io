Today was my first ever spinning class. It was very weird. I was up for 5:55am. Now while that isn't new to some people it is for me. I am the sort of tard that wont get out of bed until 7am at the earliest. So for me to see the 05 on my clock is a big thing.<br /><br />Anyway, when I got in I warmed up on the cross trainer. I know I said before that I was going to warm up on the bike, but lets face it - I was going to be on a bike for 45mins so I might as well have used the cross trainer. And there is no way in hell I am warming up on the treadmill or the stairmaster at 6:45am!!<br /><br />The class wasn't that big, probably only about 5 people in it and the trainer. To my left was some dude that was ripped to fuck, and to my right was my PT. And yes, I was the token fat guy between those two :) But my PT made me feel comfortable and the trainer taking the class was very friendly.<br /><br />We started off with two warm up songs, I didn't try and keep up to some of the music, there isn't much point in doing that at this stage. I just wanted to get through the 45mins without having to quit or take a break and I succeeded. I followed the instructions, but sometimes I didn't bother putting the gear up as I knew I was at my limit. I sweated bucket loads, and below my bike looked like Lough Neagh - but then again that is a good sign if a little disgusting.<br /><br />There were 8 songs in total and I have to say I really enjoyed it. It is a nice feeling to do something new. It is also a nice feeling to know that a few months ago I wouldn't have been able to do it.<br /><br />As the day has progressed my legs have gotten tighter but nothing really bad. I am still gonna go to the gym tomorrow and to another spinning class on Wednesday morning. Hopefully this will help me reach my goal for the end of the month.<br /><br />Feck me, I am tired right now :)<br /><br />There really isn't much else to say
