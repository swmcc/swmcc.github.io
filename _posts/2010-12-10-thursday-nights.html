I love Thursday nights.. Love them.. It is one of the rare days in the week that offers one hope.. Its a flirt of an evening, a foreplay evening that hints that soon something good will happen (Friday evening).. Back in the day it was also my TV junk night – where I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing" target="_blank">The West Wing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos" target="_blank">The Sopranos</a> and some other shows that elude me now. But it was a good night.

I now watch the political programmes. Question Time and This Week. Now that The Tories are in and the Republicans now control congress the major theme will be “the right rising again”.. I think that is a tad unfair. I think it can best be summed up by saying the following:

The right think the left are misguided and the left think the right are evil… And while these two ideological sides fight – the rest of us in the middle get beaten up <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />

I did find it funny though that Glenn Beck said the following in one of his speeches lately “Government shouldn’t create jobs, entrepreneurs do”. Now I agree with this statement. Smaller government and all that. However I heard that quote a few years back.. Senator Arnold Vinnick said it in a TV debate with Congressman Matt Santos when they were running for President… On The West Wing.. The man is an idiot. You couldn’t write it.. Or you could – then the clown would take it and make it his own four years later <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />

However I am now going to watch QT and wind myself up by watching some left wing nut doing exactly what Glenn Beck does only at the other side of the spectrum.
