<@beowulf> don't you hate it when your orange has sprouted a mini orange at the top
* beowulf wonders why an orange would want to do that
* StrayTaoist hurls. again
<@beowulf> maybe it's a defensive mechanism, like a decoy
<@StrayTaoist> what is an orange's mortal enemy? And what did it do to so offend them?
<@swm> the peach
<@beowulf> ki ora maybe
<@swm> no, the peach
<@beowulf> explain
* swm throws a peach at beowulf
<@swm> explained
<@beowulf> you sir have the intellect of a babboon
<@swm> :)
* swm gets down
<@discordia> Oh Yeah.. Get on up... Get up... Get down.... Get on up... "Do. da-da-da-da-da-da. Da" "I feel good. Like Sugar and Spice.."
