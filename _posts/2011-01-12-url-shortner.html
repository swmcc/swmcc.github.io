I have started to use <a href="http://www.twitter.com/swmcc" target="_blank">twitter</a> a bit more lately and one thing I have noticed is the URL <a href="../../a/45208/" target="_blank">shorterning</a> you can use to fit into the 140 characters. There are loads of them out there – goo.gl and bit.ly to name a few. I then started to think that I have a domain just as short as them (6 characters) – so I might as well host my own – just like <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/johngirvin" target="_blank">@johngirvin</a> does for <a href="http://girv.in/" target="_blank">girv.in</a>. I don’t want to spend anytime on it though – anything more than five mins of work is too much for something so small.<cite></cite></p>

I looked at John’s site and seen that he was using <a href="http://yourls.org/" target="_blank">YOURLS</a> but that looked like too much work (that’s how lazy I am regarding this). I wanted something that would work without me having to do any grunt work. <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=5143210+6352879591152674960" target="_blank">Google Short Links</a> might have done the trick but I would have to edit my DNS Zone settings and I really couldn’t be bothered with that. A quick google search and I came up with <a href="http://get-shorty.com/" target="_blank">Shorty</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now I am not up to date on these things, it works for me and that is all that matters. Hopefully it wont get hacked (I didn’t do any reading on how stable and secure it is – read above LAZY). I want to make use of my <a href="../../" target="_blank">swm.cc </a>domain for something. I could get rid of the redirect to my <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/stephen.mccullough" target="_blank">google homepage</a> for anyone going directly to swm.cc but I think its best to keep it. So I choose the a/ directory to host it. It is still an eight character link which is still good <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />
</p>
<p>
So all I have left to do is just start using it – <a href="../../a/49291/" target="_blank">http://swm.cc/a/49291/</a></p>

<p>
Right better get to resizing a server and moving stuff over for work..

<p>
By the way it took me about 3 minutes to set the above up – during Holby City.. Result <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />
