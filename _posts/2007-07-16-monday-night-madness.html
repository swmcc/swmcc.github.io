Well the fella that was supposed to train with me last night cancelled on me, the big wuss. I hit the gym at 7:10 - which is very late for me now, but what are you gonna do. It was pretty busy though, so I am sortta glad that it worked out this way.<br /><br />I was going to do a heavy weight session again, but I couldn't muster up the energy sitting there lifting weights again so I done a 90% cardio work out. I started with a quick jog on the treadmill for my warmup, but I was liking it that much I stayed on for a while after and done my first 'programme' on it!! I think I am going to do that from now on, and then once a week I will do sprint training.<br /><br />5 min warm up on the treadmill at speed 9.0 incline 1.5 (I remember the day when that was a proper workout).<br />3 * 15 @ 35kg rear detoild machine<br />10 mins on the stair master<br /><ul><li>5 mins at level 9</li><li>1 min at level 12</li><li>4 mins at level 9 taken two at a time</li></ul>[I am going to have to vary the sm routine, as it is getting boring]<br /><br />15 mins on the crosstrainer on hill plus at level 9 reverse mode.<br />3 * 15 @ 35kg bicep curl<br />10mins on the treadmill - on hills level 9 - speed 9.5 (this killed, but very very enjoyable).<br /><br />And that was it. Took over an hour, was done in at the end - but enjoyable. I am gonna go in tomorrow morning and do the treadmill again. I love doing something new. Also tomorrow night the sis and me are going spinning.
