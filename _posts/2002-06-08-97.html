<h3>Fight.. Fight.. Fight</h3>
<br /><p>Unless you have been under a stone lately you will know that tonight there is a big boxing match on. Lewis 'v' Tyson for those of you that are ill informed :) So what does this mean, well nothing really. It is the first big fight that <b>I</b> have been interested in since Tyson 'v' Holyfield.</p>
<br /><p>The last fight I paid for was Tyson 'v' Holyfield II. I swore after that fight I would never ever again pay for a fight as it was a disgrace what happened. So why am I paying Â£15 to watch Tyson again I hear you ask. Well I think that Lews will beat him this time, I really do. I know Tyson is usually a better fighter against bigger guys but I think Lewis can do it.. Come on you Candidan fuck wit - you can do it :)
<br /><p>I am not exactly a Tyson fan. No in fact I am not a Tyson fan. I think he was probably the worst champion that boxing has had since Sonny Liston (I think I spelt Liston correctly). Tyson is an animal and had the tools to be one of the greats but he has fallen, and should be kicked out of boxing.</p>
<br /><p>However I am not exactly a Lewis fan either, he isn't a great champion, he is a good champion - but he is a better champion than Tyson could ever be. The problem with Lewis is that he has dillusions of grandure, he thinks that he is the best since Ali. I can some that statement in one word: <b>Bollocks</b>. The best since Ali (IMHO) was, well, err Geroge Forman :) No really Evander Holyfield, while he isn't exactly a natural heavyweight he still fought great fights against, Bowe (three times), Tyson (3 times), Lewis (2 times) and Michael Moorer. This IMHO makes him the best since Ali. I think Riddick Bowe could have been one of the greats but he got greedy and lost his heart, but there you go :( The fact that you could even conisder George Foreman as one of the best since Ali just confirms how bad the division really is.</p>
<br /><p>Hopefully tonight we will see Lewis put and end to the 'old' era of crappy alphabet boys and paper champions. I want Lewis to put down Tyson and retire, and let the new boys come up and restablish the heavyweight division as one of the best divisons in boxing. If only Roy Jones was two or three inches taller and a stone heavier he could be a heavyweight, but alas no:(</p><p>SWM's verdict: Lewis in the 7th.. I don't think this one will go the distance, Tyson wont let it.</p>
