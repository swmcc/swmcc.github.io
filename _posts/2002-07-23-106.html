<h3>Right... moving on</h3>
<br /><p>Okay I am moving this blog soon. I will install moveabletype on my machine soon, so I can get rid of this awful blogger nonesense..
<br />The next version of swmcc.com is coming along nicely, it is live on another site, but I am not giving that you yet. The display logic and the
<br />code thingies :) are seperate now. There is no more HTML in my code at all. However I can't pass any variables into my parse files.. yet.
<br />The Parser just reads in an HTML file and outputs it. I can't be arsed writing one that can put variables in. Anyway my big plan is to get the new version of swmcc.com up and then move onto Template::Toolkit. But I decided to get everything seperated out and re-write my modules first.</p>
<br /><p>So, hopefully the new version of swmcc.com will be live soon, as I had to take down the live site because I moved some component files
