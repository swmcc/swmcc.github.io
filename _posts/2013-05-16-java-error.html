<pre>
0000-00-00 00:00:00^@' can not be represented as java.sql.Timestamp
</pre>

If you ever get the above error when parsing dates using java or groovy and the data you are getting is from MySQL then just add <pre>?zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull</pre> to your connection string.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
def sth   = Sql.newInstance('jdbc:mysql://hostname:port/dbname?zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull&characterEncoding=utf-8&useUnicode=true', 'user', 'password', 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver')
</pre>
</p>
<p>Then any dates that were 0000-00-000 will come out as null and the code wont error. This is my solution anyway and it took me a while to find it. Hopefully this will help someone else that isn't really all that sure about groovy/java.</p>
