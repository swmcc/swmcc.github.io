Well my third day back. Still only done 45mins, still not at 100%. As it was Sunday though I done mostly weights. Tomorrow I will try running, cycling and the horrible stair master. Went in at 12. I really hate going in at that time, but its my bro's birthday today. Which is worrying me slightly. My Mum has made spaghetti bologense. Which is great, I am looking forward to that, but the cake and buns afterwards is annoying me. Not that I don't think I can control myself, I can - but I just don't want to eat any, but if I refuse to eat any then she will take offense. One of the worst things about being on a diet is people that aren't trying to lose weight really don't understand what it is like cutting out stuff. But sure, I'll get over it.<br /><br />I was that tired when I got back yesterday that I slept for 5 hours during the day. I think this is my bodys way of saying "Wow... Hang on". But I am not going to stop going, even 45mins makes me feel much better.<br /><br />I gained a bit of weight back today, not much - about half a pound, and with my leg still being swollen that is to be expected.<br /><br />I'll go for my usual walk tonight and that might losen up the whole thing. I'll head back to the gym tomorrow at my usual time of late afternoon. Tomorrow is a bank holiday so hopefully I will get a few rounds of golf in as well.<br /><br />I don't know the names of the machines so I can't post what I done. However I am gonna start taking a book with me to the gym and charting my progress.<br /><br />Looking forward to tomorrow. Looking forward to getting back to normal. Damn body, not doing what I want it to :)
