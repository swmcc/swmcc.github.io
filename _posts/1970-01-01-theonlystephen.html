<p>This site! You are on it :)</p>
<p>This site is built on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and designed 
by the wonderful <a href="http://melissakeizer.com/">Melissa Keizer.</a></p>
<p>Like everything I do it is tested to within an inch of its life using 
<a href="https://mochajs.org/">mocha</a>. Along side this I use <a href="http://codeship.com">codeship</a>
 for a Continous Delivery solution (if the tests pass).
