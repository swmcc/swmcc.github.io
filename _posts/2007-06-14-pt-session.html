Well the PT session was pretty good. I didn't lose any weight this week, which was a bad thing. I knew I was lighter on Monday, but I have to admit to being 'bad' on Monday night with 'The Sopranos' final. I had the following:<br /><br />* 1 Bag of hula-hoops<br />* 1 Bag of wine gums<br />* 1 litre of Ben 'n' Jerrys cookie dough<br />* 500ml bottle of coke<br /><br />That was a bad idea, the carbs from the ice-cream was enough to set me back I think. But as the PT said (I never told her about the ice-cream) I just have to look at it as my first real major slip up and move on. However she did tell me I had to loose 1kg between now and Sunday or I have to do 20mins on the stair master at level 8 for 20mins. To be honest with the exercise I am doing now the weight should be flying off, but that will only happen when the diet is correct and this week it wasn't.<br /><br />The session involved mostly weights in circuits of three, with the weight going harder every time, and then on the third set of ever weight I had to go until I 'failed' :) Was fuckin torture. Towards the end I had to go into the studio, but I was sweating so much that when I was doing my mat work the sweat was running, actually running off my head onto the mat like a tap. It was disgusting :)<br /><br />I am near sure I wont get down 1kg in a few days, it just wont happen - and I think its the PT's way of punishing me for not losing any weight this week :)<br /><br />I am having a 'forced off' day today, which is annoying - the car is in being fixed. I'll go for a run tonight but it isn't the same. I hate things fecking with my routine.
