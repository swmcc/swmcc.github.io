Grrrr. I gained 1kg from yesterday - how the fuck did that happen? I am really quite gutted about that to be honest. Must be water somewhere or something. I never thought I would go by that number so much. Grrrrrrrrr.<br /><br />Anyway, I wanted to be in the gym at around 7 this morning because I have several things to be getting on with this evening, but a friend popped round last night and didn't leave until 12.45am!! And as I was up at 5:55am the previous morning I was wrecked - that was over 18hours on my feet - I don't do well without sleep. As a result I didn't get up until 7.30 which means that traffic is heavy into Belfast and to cut a long story short I didn't get in the gym and started until 8.25!! Grrrrrr again.<br /><br />I done mostly cardio - with one set of weights.<br /><br />5mins at level 8 - 12 for a warmup on the crosstrainer.<br />15 * 3 @ 40kg machine curl.<br />15mins on the treadmill - level 9 at incline 1.5 for 1mile - then various levels for the reminder of the time. I done a mixture of sprints at level 11.5 and hills at incline 4.5 at speeds of 8 - 9.5 for 1min at a time.<br />15mins cross trainer - level 8 - 15 reverse mode on hills.<br /><br />That was it. The 15mins on the treadmill took it out of me to be honest :) The mixture of stuff at the end was very good and enjoyable. I am going to go out running on the road tonight so didn't want to over-do it - but I still sweated like a mad thing though. I will hopefully get 2miles done tonight but we will see.<br /><br />Looking forward to the spinning class tomorrow. But boy am I tired now.
