So, I am looking for a new car. The current car is due to go through the MOT on Monday (boo, boo - hiss). Hopefully it will go through and then I can go and sell her.

I am looking at several alternatives, I don't believe in buying a new car, as it loses way too much money. So I am looking at a Renault Megane or a Pugeot 306. I would prefer the Megane though.

My current Insurance company does not insure people under 25, yet I am 23. Weird that. I will give them one more try, if they fail to answer my questions and just fob me off I will try another company.

Insurance in this country is a bitch, really, a big fat bitch
