I went into the gym a bit later than usual, around 3.30pm - not sure why though. Anyway the workout was okay, a bit longer than my usual weight session. A typical weight session lasts for around 45mins for me, and a good cardio one is usually an hour. This one lasted 1hour 10mins, and I didn't take my time either - not much rests between sets or different exercises.<br /><br />5 min warm up on the bike, level 9 speed always about 115. 3.8km<br />15 * 3 @ 56kg on the seated row. Each set with a different grip.<br /><br />[Circut]<br />15 * 3 @ 56kg Chest Press<br />15 * 3 @ 35kg Rear Deltoid Machine<br />15 * 3 Seated Dip<br /><br />10 mins on the stair master<br /><ul><li>5 mins at level 9</li><li>1.30mins at level 12</li><li>30secs at level 14</li><li>3mins at level 9 taking two steps at a time</li></ul>15 * 3 @ 22.5kg free weight seated chest press<br />15 * 3 @ 22.5kg raised front row<br />12 * 3 @ 11.25kg each underhead tricep extension on the pulley machine<br />10 * 3 @ 14kg free weight bicep curl<br />15 * 3 @ 40kg over head tricep extension<br />10 * 3 pushups with the last one in each set held for 10 secs.<br /><br />I am quite happy with that workout. Tomorrow morning is Spin, and tomorrow evening I should have a buddy to go lifting with which I am sortta looking forward to. Will see what happens.<br /><br />I have a rather big rant about gym people.. I'll do that later - mainly due to the fact that I have to make my tuna salad dinner now nad I don't want to be eating anything big after 7pm. How things have changed..
