Okay... If anyone reading this has the Buffy Board Game can they please email me and tell me how the fuck to play it.. It was way to confusing. Ruth bought me it for Christmas and it is a cool game but I am too thick to understand how to play it.. If you know please contact me by either clicking the Contact link below or emailing me at thebuffygame@swmcc.com.
