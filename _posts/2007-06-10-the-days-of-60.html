I woke up at 8am this mornin and had a mild panic attack!! It was Monday (I thought) and it was 8am which meant I missed my spinning class! More importantly it meant I messed the PT about, and those that know that PT know not to mess her about!! I checked my mobile, no messages.. What? Ohhh, maybe she didn't go.. ohh hang on its Sunday - relax :) Those first 30secs of the day scared the living be-jesus out of me. I never thought I was that scared of her :)<br /><br />I rolled over again and didn't get up until 10.30am, fixed myself some breakfast and decided to go for another 2mile run in the morning, however there were too many people on the roads with their kids and dogs so I went for a lesuirely stroll instead.<br /><br />I got to the gym at around 3:15 and by the time I got changed it was 3.30pm. Sunday is usually my heavy weight day, but I done a good bit of weights yesterday so I decided to do a few machine weights, but instead of doing 3 reps of say 10,12 or 15 that I would just do 60 reps in 3 sets of 20 at very heavy weights. Boy it hoit!! I also skipped for a good solid 7mins full tilt.<br /><br />5min warm up on the crosstrainer (1.1km at level 8)<br />20*3 incline chest press @ 20kg each arm<br />20*3 chest press @ 56kg<br />20*3 bicep curl @ 42kg (that was tough)<br />7mins skipping<br />20*3 lateral raise @ 42kg (my arms stopped responding at this stage).;<br />15mins on the crosstrainer on hills on reverse mode at level 9 with speeds to 15/16 for 5mins on normal mode then 2mins when on reverse mode I shoved it up to level 16 and kept the speed between 8-9.<br />5min sprint on the treadmill at level 10.<br />Stretching<br /><br />All in all I was there for over an hour. My weight is up a bit from yesterday though. Should have it shifted come Thursday. I also done 5 holes of golf - I parred two of the holes as well!!! That was a nice suprise. I will go for a walk later on to losen my legs up.<br /><br />Spinning class tomorrow. According to the PT the training sessions last week were pretty easy compared to how much this trainer is gonna be!!! This is going to get messy I can forsee it :)
