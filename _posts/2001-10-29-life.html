Mmm... Been really really lazy so I have... Well I was at a Windoze training course for the last two weeks, so you can't really blame if I haven't been updating this site. Anyway I will get round to doing something soon. But on another note my car was broken into again (after me getting a new drivers door after the last attempt), this time it was the passengers door that got it. The little bastards pulled at the top of the door - I could actucally get my hand in through the opening, luckily they were scared off so I think I got it fixed... Thank feck.. Something bad always happens on the 27th Oct, last year I was made redundant from BlackStar. Ahh well everything seems to be okday now!!! (touch wood)
