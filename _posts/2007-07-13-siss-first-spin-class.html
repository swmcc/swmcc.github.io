I took the sister to her first spin class today. It wasn't the PT doing the class I thought it was. Instead it was the hardcore nutter one that even my PT doesn't go near. I suppose if you done /exactly/ what he said you would find it a good class, but I am afraid I didn't. Either he was out of practise or I wasn't in the mood. He even admitted that this was his first class in three months.<br /><br />I am not sure what it was, firstly the music was crap, and secondly he was too cocky for his own good. The thing I like about the usual PT that does it is that he only talks to motivate you, and tell you what to do. The fella that done the class today was just talking to fill in the void, which wasn't really necessary.<br /><br />Christina got it tough I think, she said that 15mins she was getting it real tight. I told her beforehand to pace herself, but she didn't and paid the price. I took it hard enough until the last three songs and then gave it dixie. I didn't sweat anywhere near as much as I usually do, but my legs were worked alot harder. It was just completly different, and not in a good way.<br /><br />I think Christina liked it though, I hope she did anyway. I told her to come to the next one where the usual fella is doing it and she should enjoy that. The thing I like about the other fella is that he always, always, /always/ ends with a mountain climb. We ended in sprints this time and it just didn't feel right :)<br /><br />I know I said previously I wanted a different routine.. I now admit it. I don't :)
