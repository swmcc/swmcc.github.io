<h3>Ali - du Film</h3>
<br /><p>Now I wouldn't call myself an expert in regards to boxing, I know my shit but I don't know enough to be called an expert. However I am an expert on the life of Ali. I like reading biographies. Currently I am reading a biography on the World War II American Generals, very interesting. Anyway back to the topic. I got round to watching Ali, the film that Will Smith starred in. I have to say Smith was excellent as Ali, he really got it down to a 'T'. But the film was a bit boring IMO. I already knew about the fights, I am such a geek when it comes to boxing that I knew when and where he was gonna get knocked out (not just the round and the minute, but where exactly they were in the ring).
<br /></p><p>I wanted to see more about the politics between him and Malcom X, The Nation of Islam, The U.S Government. His inner tormoils with the women and what it felt like to be took out of boxing in his prime. What it felt like to lose to Fraizer. I thought the part where Ali was jogging in Zaire was a bit cheesy. This is where (in the film) that he realises that he is more than a boxer, he is a poltical and cultural icon. It was really cheesy, but I suppose they had to get it across in the film for those that know nothing of Ali.</p>
<br /><p>I would have also preferred it if they could have shown the realtionships between Ali &amp; Frazer, Foreman, Norton etc. That would have been interesting. I think that if you were a fan of Ali and knew a good bit about him it was a boring film, however if  you didn't know anyting about Ali you would have probably thought it was quite good (like my Sister did).</p>
<br /><p>Ahh well... I suppose it could have been worse</p>
