I helped my Dad from 1pm yesterday until 10pm - moving stuff out of the bathroom, dismantling a shed and burning it, laying stones. The worst thing about it was that I was the fella in charge. Now I am not sure why that happened. I am way more physically capable than I have been in the past so I could do more without having to have a break every 15minutes. My Dad is also approaching 60 and has slowed down a good bit lately. Anyway it was a very intensive day and I was tired at the end of it.<br /><br />My alarm went off at 5:55am, but I hit the snooze button and didn't get up until 8:45am. Again I am not sure if it is a combination of things or the PT thing again. Either way I didn't go and feel like crap. I couldn't even go in the evening as I had to finish off the jobs that I started yesterday, which will take me all evening.<br /><br />Getting no exercise and having my weight up from yesterday is making me feel like crap. I also had a rather big lunch, I am over-eating and it is making me feel like shite and I hate it. But sure.. Tomorrow is a new day and that. I am going to hit the gym in the late afternoon though. It will give me a good indication of my weight, which I am not expecting to be good.
