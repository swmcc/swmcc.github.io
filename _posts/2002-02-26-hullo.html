Some ppl think I am fired because of the diary entry for the 7th Feb. I am not fired, Rory sent that to me as a joke (isn't it funny!). So I am stating here that I am not fired. But if you want to employ me you still can :)

Also ppl are commenting on how weird Wee Moffett looks (see the entry for the 24th). I would like to say that she dosen't look that weird in real life, but is just as scary.
