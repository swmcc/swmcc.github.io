<p>I have a side project (link not given) that utilizes the nestoria API to give a MVP. The app is written in django so I had to find a python library. One exists but it doesn't really suit what I want to do plus it is close to seven years of age. So I wrote one that suits my needs, it is fairly opinionated.</p>

<p>It has stalled lately (Sept 15) however I intend to pick it up again in the near future.</p>
