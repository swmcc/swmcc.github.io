<h3>New Look</h3>
<br /><p>So I finally checked what my blog looked like on NN. And boy did it look shite. So I opted for a no frills template, and it seems to work fine.</p>
<br /><p>I am seriously thinking about getting a degree, or at least trying to. Finally my certificate came through last week saying that I completed the HND Software Engineering course. It was only a few years late!. This means that if I opt for a OU type degree I can add extra credit to it, which was my main stumbling block before this. Well this and money, I start a new <a href="http://www.blackstar.co.uk">job</a> next week so I will be getting paid proper money now :) So maybe just maybe I can afford it</p>
