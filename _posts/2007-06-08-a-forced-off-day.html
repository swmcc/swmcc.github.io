Today I was forced to have an 'off day'. I was supposed to wake up at 6:55 and be in the gym fo 7.30ish. However I hit the snooze button and the rest is history :) I couldn't go after work as my car had to be taken away and a rather noisy wheel bearing fixed.<br /><br />As I had no mode of transportation I stayed at home on my lonesome. Big mistake, my brain being the sneaky bastard it is started to play tricks with me. I was watching a film and my brain started saying "Ohhhh lets buy some Ben &amp; Jerry's ice-cream".. And the sneaky bastard almost got me talked into it. So instead of walking to the shop I decided to go for a three mile run at 10.30pm on a Friday night :) It worked a treat :)<br /><br />I think that's what I will do from now on. My brain will have to find a new way to trick me :)
