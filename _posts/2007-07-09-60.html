I didn't get to go golfing yesterday, damn rain. Ahhh well. I also didn't get up to go to spin class this morning. And I feel guiiillllttty as hell, but sure.<br /><br />I got to the gym after work at around 6 and the place was bunged. But sure, screw it.<br /><br />5mins on the cross trainer at level 9 - 1.3km<br />3 * 10 on the lateral raise @ 40kg.<br />20mins on the cross trainer - hill plus - level 9 - 12 - kept the speed between 15-17 the whole time.<br /><br /><blockquote>Am quite proud of that to be honest. It didn't kill me as much as I thought and I could have went on for another 10. But I was getting bored and the person beside me was constantly looking at my screen to see what I was doing.<br /></blockquote>3 * 15 @ 42kg on the butterfly machine.<br />15mins on the stair master<br /><br /><ul><li>5mins at level 9</li><li>1min at level 12</li><li>1min at level 13</li><li>2mins at level 8 taken two at a time</li><li>1min at level 9 taken two at a time.</li></ul><br />I found the cardio a bit too easy to be honest. I could have went for a run or something afterwards, but I knew whatever I done next would push me over the edge and I'd be sore afterwards. I want to keep a constant push of cardio this week.
