As stated before Sundays is when me lifts the weightsis :)<br /><br />I done a quick warmup on the cross trainer (I couldn't use the bikes as they were all taken). I then went upstairs and done every weight machine (apart from the leg ones). All heavy (for me anyway). I also done a few free weights and some skipping in the studio.<br /><br />10 * 4 @ 42kg - Lateral Raise<br />15 * 3 @ 42kg - Pectoral Fly<br />15 * 4 @ 42kg - Butterfly<br />15 * 4 @ 42kg - Chest Press<br />15 * 3 @ 42kg - Tricep machine upstairs that I can't remember :)<br />15 * 4 @ 42kg - Big bar thingy upstairs :)<br />10 * 3 @ 28kg - Free weight curl<br />10 * 3 for each arm on the pully machine - various muscles used.<br />15 * 3 * 2 (each leg) @ 10kg - Free weight curl but standing on one leg each set.<br />10 mins of skipping (not non stop - but 10mins spent in the stuido).<br /><br />Feel quite good after all that. I am looking forward to the spin class tomorrow, it should be interesting ;) I am still losing a bit of weight but should be 1kg down by now, but then it was the weekend and I let myself go a bit these last two days. My cheat day was moved to Friday and I had a manky chinese, and boy it felt gooooooooood. On Saturday I went into starbucks and had a hot choc and a muffin. However I think its good not to be too anal about the food I eat, as long as I don't over do it. But we will see. I want to be 1kg down from last week come Thursday, and I am sure that the spin class will see to that :)<br /><br />7am tomorrow morning, which means I have to be in the gym for a quick warm up by 06:50. I might even see the 05 on my clock!! But who am I kidding, I love it - I love the change it is making to me both physically and mentaly. I shoulda started this shit years ago :)
