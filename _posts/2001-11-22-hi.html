I'm still feeling rather shit at the minute.. Got a really sore head and my throat feels like barbed wire... I am in work at the minute and would love to go home right now, however I cannot :(

I just registered for a <a href="http://search.cpan.org">CPAN</a> id. Once I get confirmation I will post up where you can get my lovely modules that will make life soo much easier (heavy sarcasm)...

Right I am away to feel sorry for myself now!!!
