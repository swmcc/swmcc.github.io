Full training is back on. And boy it feels good.<br /><br />Today was my PT day. I got weighed, the weight is still coming off nicely. She gave me two goals, to lose a stone (14lb) by the end of this month for two free sessions. I think it can be done, I'll give it a go anyway.<br /><br />The session went really well. Mostly mat work at the start, then she spied a 'spin bike'. I went on that for 10mins and it almost killed me. However I have start doing a spin class at 7am on a Monday morning and a Wednesday morning :) I really don't know what I am gonna do - I am looking forward to it, but its gonna be tough. But then again that's a good thing :)<br /><br />After the spin taster we done a good bit of weights. My arms are killing me at the mo, I wonder how bad they will be in the morning.<br /><br />All in all I was very happy today. I was pushed hard and came out the other side. I'll be in early tomorrow morning for an another hour session.
