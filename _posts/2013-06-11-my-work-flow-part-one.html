<p>
At the beginning of May I decided to reinvent my workflow. For the last thirteen odd years it has remained pretty stable with <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> being my main editor and any interface with infrastructure or assests done via the command line or a web browser. My languages have been pretty varied too however like any developer worth their salt the languages varying had little impact on my workflow (see what happens when you don't tie yourself to an IDE). At the same time I've moved from using <a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/"aegis</a>,<a href="http://cvs.nongnu.org/">cvs</a>, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.
