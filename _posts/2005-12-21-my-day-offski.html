On the last week before Christmas I always take my Mum out to Belfast for a day so she can do the last bit of shopping she needs. While I am there I always treat her to a Christmas dinner, I think its only fair as she slaves over the proper one. I try and help, but to be honest this is no ordinary dinner, and only a very very brave person would venture into our kitchen on the 24/25th December. I suppose she has gotten into a routine now and having someone about the kitchen would actually hold her back. When my Grandmother was alive she used to direct the traffic in the kitchen and my Mum was in the way. Neither Me, The Bro, or The Leech have been promoted yet to find out the preparation secrets. I think I might be getting groomed for it though since I am the only one that shows any interest. Its not something that is handed down easily though, after all it took my Mum to be near 40 before she was let in on the hidden secrets of 'Christmas Dinner'.</p>

Anyway, I am sick at the minute with a bad leg, so we decided to skip the christmas shopping but as it was actually a day off for me and not a sick day I didn't feel guilty in heading into town to get our dinner at the Northern Whig. You can see a write up at Mr. Wulf's site, by clicking here.</p>

I am a bit gutted at not getting in to do any shopping though, I still have to get The Bro, Moffett, Ruthie and my Uncle Sam presents. Hopefully if I rest my leg enough I might be able to head in on Friday or Saturday morning. I don't intend to head back into work for the rest of this week though. Standing about and walking about isn't as painful as sitting at a desk, plus its heading up to christmas and everything is starting to wind down. I'll be working from home though. The only bad thing is the anti-biotics keep me up all night, I didn't get to sleep until 4.30am yesterday. I was so tired when I got back from Belfast and our dinner that I feel asleep on my parents couch in the TV room, and only woke up cos Higgels was bored and wanted to use me as a bouncy castle.</p>

I am actually sitting here typing this out at 12.30am and I can't feel one bit of tiredness on me at all, even though I know should be as I have only had 5 hours sleep in the last 48hrs. That's the thing with these fucking anti-biotics they just like fucking you up for no good reason. I took my last dose of pills at 10.30 - which by my calculations will let me go to sleep by 2.30, maybe 3am. Ahh well.
