<h3>123Mb too much</h3>
<br /><p>Microsoft Windows SP3 is out tomorrow. And guess what it is 124Mb :).</p>
<br /><p>Any System Administrator that is downloading that must think at some stage "What the fuck is going on here?". 124Mb... what are they on? I have had the privleage of mainting several window networks, some ranging from just three computers to one that had over 60. And I can say now that it wasn't fun, I hated it in fact. Not that I hate Sys Admining, I just hate Windows and how inferior it is. I am lucky that I got out of the Windoze crap before this came out, I can just imagine people ringing me up and telling me that this and that doesn't work because they just done a 'Windows Update'. *shudder*. In this job I also maintained several Linux boxes, and I done updates on them as well, and nothing wrong happened. So there you go... 124Mb and for what, I bet you that at least 20Mb is dedicated to Instant Messenger... Grrr.. I better stop ranting now or I will go on and on....</p>
