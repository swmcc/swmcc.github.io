So.. Christina is home now, which is pretty good. She isn't allowed out of the house for two weeks or she risks getting an infection in her throat. She is also drugged up on some crazy pink pills. I remember those pills form DesntistfuckwitGate last year (when the dentist cut away half of my gum). Ohhh those pills are nice. I think she preferred the morphine though :)</p>

But seriously I thought getting your tonsils out was a simple procedure, but it seems the operation is the only simple part, the rest is shite. Also my Dad now has the cold, which is of course, a lot more painful than what Christina is going through now. Big fecking wuss.</p>
