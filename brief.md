# My Website

I want my website to be a mis-mash of a blog and a portfolio with links to my twitter, github and linkedin. I don’t want to say too much about myself personally.

The domain is swm.cc. My initials. Don’t want it to say Stephen McCullough. I am in a bit of a privacy mode at the mo. That’s why I took away my twitter for public access, deleted my FB and took away my old site site. The previous site had everything on it.

## Technology

It will be hosted using github pages. It’ll be a [jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) site.

## Structure/Layout

Not sure - you tell me. Should it be a one page site - apart from the blog? I don’t care. I do think the blog has to be its own page. I will utilise jekyll for the categories (meta information) and perma links. If it is separate pages I don’t care. Its whatever you think on this. In this document I will refer to it as ‘sections’ this can mean sections or pages.

### Sections

    1. ‘homepage’ - this should probably have the tagline “Developer from Belfast”. Probably the five latest articles on my blog (I’ll utilise this with jekyll). A link to my portfolio, cv and blog (though they can get to the blog via the five links) this will be a link to the index of the blog. Possibly buttons for my github, twitter and linkedin here.

    2. ‘portfolio’ - this should be an index page/section. Where I have a link of my github contributions (though since i deleted my email address github thinks I have done fook all). And any personal projects I have. I like this fellas site as re: portfolio - a row of three images [image with a blurb](http://ianlunn.co.uk/lab/) - you hover over an image and it does the magnifying thing. Below that you have an ‘All’ section where I can put the boring stuffs. The links on this page should then go to something like this:

        http://ianlunn.co.uk/portfolio/css3-foundations/

    3. Blog - just your standard blog shite really. If you can give me a front page (that should just be a simple list of entries I have), an individual page and possibly a category page then that’s it. I can use jekyll to wank this out from there. I like having a featured portion on the front page. More often than not I think it’ll be the latest entry. So the index page will be the index and archive page in one - but at the top of the page is a blurb of the latest entry - title and say 50 words on it. Each title I think should have up to five category tags on it. These will then link to the category page. Like this [hairy dude](http://www.barrygordon.co.uk/) I can join this all up in jekyll. 

    Blogs I like:

        https://github.com/blog
        http://rumblelabs.com/blog/

        and much as I hate to admit it:

        http://www.leemunroe.com/blog/
        
## Logo

A wee logo would be nice - https://github.com/swmcc as you can see I don’t have one. Just a simple play on swmcc would do if that is handy. My actual initials are SWMcC - but am more than happy with it all being lower case. This logo will then be used in twitter, github, this site as a favicon.ico

## Colours/Fonts

You asked me for colours I like as well as fonts.. My boyo I haven't a fooking clue about such vodoo things :) Whatever you pick is good enough for me :)
