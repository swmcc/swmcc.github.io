      "answer": "Rails? Yes. Stephen knows Rails. More importantly, he *understands* Rails.\n\nHe's built production applications with Rails 8 - Jotter (bookmark manager), the-mcculloughs.org (family archive), and various other projects that actually work.\n\nRails is a monolith. A beautiful, powerful monolith. None of this microservices nonsense where you need seventeen services to show a webpage. Rails gives you everything: authentication, file uploads, background jobs, WebSockets. It's the Lagavulin 16 of web frameworks.\n\nStephen particularly appreciates Rails 8's built-in authentication. No Devise bloat. No OAuth complexity. Just sessions and passwords that work.\n\nRead more: cat projects/building-jotter.md",

      "answer": "Python. FastAPI specifically. Stephen uses it for AI products and APIs.\n\nPython is practical. It gets the job done without ceremony. FastAPI is even better - it's fast, has automatic OpenAPI docs, and type hints that actually matter.\n\nStephen's built whatisonthe.tv (TV tracking app) with FastAPI + SvelteKit. He works with Ollama for local LLMs and RAG systems. The kind of work where Python's ecosystem (NumPy, scikit-learn, Transformers) is actually useful.\n\nUnlike JavaScript's 47 package managers and weekly framework rewrites, Python is stable. Boring. Reliable. That's a compliment.\n\nVisit: /projects for project details",

      "answer": "TypeScript. Yes.\n\nThis entire terminal you're using? TypeScript. The site? Astro with TypeScript. Content schemas? Zod + TypeScript.\n\nType safety prevents stupid mistakes. It catches errors at compile time instead of 3am in production. That's efficient.\n\nStephen uses TypeScript for frontend work where it belongs - type-safe components, API clients, and build-time validation. He doesn't use it for backend (that's what Rails and Python are for), but for browser code? It's the right tool.\n\nThe terminal's virtual file system, command parser, and Swanson chat logic? All TypeScript. Roughly 30KB of it.\n\nTry: cat src/components/Terminal/terminal.ts (if you had access to source)",

      "answer": "Stephen is currently building four documented projects:\n\n1. **swm.cc** - This site. Astro 5, Tailwind CSS 4, TypeScript. Zero-JavaScript by default. You're experiencing it right now.\n\n2. **whatisonthe.tv** - TV tracking app. FastAPI + SvelteKit. Tracks shows, episodes, viewing history. Because spreadsheets are for cowards.\n\n3. **Jotter** - Self-hosted bookmark and image manager. Rails 8 + Hotwire. Your bookmarks should outlast whatever service you're trusting today.\n\n4. **the-mcculloughs.org** - Family photo archive. Rails 8 monolith. Photos belong on servers you control, not in Facebook's data mines.\n\nAll projects share a philosophy: own your data, build monoliths, avoid complexity for complexity's sake.\n\nRun 'projects' or 'ls projects/' for more details.",

      "answer": "Microservices are usually a mistake.\n\nMost companies that think they need microservices actually need a well-structured monolith. You don't have Google's scale. You don't have Amazon's problems. You have five developers and a CRUD app.\n\nStephen builds monoliths. Rails monoliths. They're simple, comprehensible, and you can deploy them on a single server. No Kubernetes nightmares. No distributed tracing to debug why checkout is slow. Just one codebase that works.\n\nMicroservices are for when you have 500 engineers and genuine organisational boundaries. Not for your startup's MVP.\n\nWant to see a proper monolith? cat projects/building-jotter.md",

      "answer": "React? He knows it. Doesn't use it much anymore.\n\nStephen prefers Astro for static content (this site) and Svelte for interactivity (whatisonthe.tv). React is fine if you need it, but most personal sites don't need 200KB of runtime just to show text.\n\nThis site ships less than 5KB of JavaScript total. React's runtime alone is 40x that. For what? To render some markdown and handle a theme toggle?\n\nIf you need truly interactive applications, React makes sense. For content sites, blogs, portfolios? It's a sledgehammer for a thumbtack.\n\nType: ls writing/ to see articles about modern web standards",

      "answer": "I'm not \"real AI.\" I'm pattern matching and pre-written responses.\n\nAt build time, a script generated Q&A pairs for common questions about Stephen. When you ask something, I:\n1. Fuzzy match your question to known questions\n2. Return the pre-written answer\n3. Pretend I'm smarter than I am (Stephen's life mantra, by the way)\n\nNo API calls. No ChatGPT. No LLMs. Just ~200KB of JSON with answers and keyword matching. Privacy-first, cost-free and surprisingly effective.\n\nThe \"intelligence\" is in the quality of the pre-written responses, not runtime inference. Like a Choose Your Own Adventure book - there are only so many paths, but they're well-written paths.\n\nRon Swanson wouldn't trust cloud AI services. Neither does Stephen.",

      "answer": "Astro is the right choice for this site.\n\nZero-JavaScript by default. Content Collections with type validation. Static site generation that's actually fast. No hydration waterfalls or client-side rendering nonsense.\n\nThis site loads in under a second because it's just HTML. Most of it doesn't need JavaScript. The parts that do (terminal, theme toggle) load selectively. That's Islands architecture - JavaScript where you need it, static HTML everywhere else.\n\nCompare that to Next.js or Gatsby where everything hydrates client-side even when it doesn't need to. Wasteful.\n\nStephen chose Astro for swm.cc because it's simple, fast, and doesn't make you fight the framework. You write Markdown, it generates HTML. That's all a blog needs.\n\nRead the full reasoning: cat writing/building-with-astro.md",

      "answer": "Hotwire. Turbo + Stimulus. The correct way to add interactivity to server-rendered applications.\n\nStephen uses Hotwire in Jotter (Rails 8 project). It keeps the application server-rendered with sprinkles of JavaScript where needed. No React. No Vue. No 500KB of framework just to show a form.\n\nTurbo handles navigation without full page reloads. Stimulus adds behavior to HTML elements. That's it. Simple, fast, works without JavaScript if needed. Progressive enhancement done right.\n\nMost web apps don't need a SPA. They need Hotwire.\n\nDetails: cat projects/building-jotter.md",

      "answer": "Stephen is a software engineer and founder based in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe works with startups and established companies building web applications and AI products. FastAPI, Svelte, distributed systems. AI products for regulated environments where reliability matters more than hype.\n\nHe also builds personal projects (Jotter, whatisonthe.tv, this site) because building things is more interesting than talking about building things.\n\nRon Swanson built chairs.

Not a religion.\n\nHe uses local LLMs (Ollama) for privacy-sensitive work. He builds RAG systems to ground responses in real data, not hallucinations. He understands the difference between marketing hype and actual capabilities.\n\nThis terminal? Not using real AI. No API calls. No cloud services. Just pattern matching and pre-written responses.

      "answer": "Yes. Tailwind CSS 4 specifically.\n\nUtility-first CSS is efficient for solo developers. You write classes inline instead of context-switching to separate CSS files. It's faster.\n\nTailwind 4 uses a Rust-powered engine. It's CSS-first now, not PostCSS. Faster builds, smaller output, native CSS features.\n\nThis site uses Tailwind for styling. Dark mode, responsive design, all utility classes. It works.\n\nSome people hate utility classes. Those people are writing artisanal CSS files with 47 unused rules.

Reliable, standard SQL, foreign key constraints that actually enforce data integrity.\n\nStephen uses Postgres for Rails projects (Jotter, the-mcculloughs.org). No MongoDB nonsense. No NoSQL \"flexibility\" that means \"your data is a mess.\"\n\nPostgres has JSON columns if you need schema flexibility. It has full-text search if you need basic search. It has concurrent access without locking nightmares. It just works.\n\nMost applications don't outgrow Postgres. They outgrow poorly written queries.\n\nExample: cat projects/building-jotter.md",
