			<p>I have never really had a homepage before so this really was a blank canvas. I am no good at designing or graphics, CSS holds little interest for me (I will do it if I have to though). So instead of spending time designing a site and playing with CSS I decided to go onto <a href="http://www.csstemplatesfree.org/">csstemplatesfree.org</a> and after a few minutes looking about I decided on the <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/nettuts/658_freeTemplate/Final%20File/index.html">Aurelius</a> theme.</p>
			<p>The reason for never having a homepage (before it was straight onto a blog or a holderpage for google+ or about.me) was mainly due to never really having a good idea for one. Other than the standard "this is me" pages I never seen one that grabbed me. Then I came across <a href="http://tomg.co/">Tom Gallacher</a> and his site inspired me to make a theme based site. It wouldn't be too hard - with some jquery, css and a bit of graft it would be possible. Obviously I didn't want to copy him verbatim as I would learn nothing. So I opened up sublime and started to 'hack at it'.</p>
			<p>Tom's site is written in node.js and uses the excellent <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> framework. I have written a few 'apps' in it (to be released soon) but decided against for this site. Instead I opted to write my terminal using <a href="http://mootools.net/">mootools</a> and just hand crafted JS instead of being smart like Tom did. At some point I would like to move to node.js/express with it - but only after I have crafted my own direction. If I'd have just forked Tom's excellent version it would have been a poor copy of his.</p>
			<p>The terminal is apt for me as I love the terminal. Also as a programmer I spend a bit of time in it and with the added bonus of every hipster programmer thinking it is old school it might annoy a few people :). Obviously there is only so much you can do on a terminal so I had to offer a 'gui' version as noted above. To get to this you can either go directly to the /gui/ directory or type in 'startx' to bring it up. If I was more graphically inclined I would put up something that would look like a boot up - but this works just as well I guess.</p>
			<p>Since this is all done in HTML/CSS I will probably re-write it to be written in jekyll or at least the portfolio portions as its a bit of hassle to add a new project. Too much copying and pasting and that is never a good thing. So watch this space. Please feel free to fork it on github.</p>
