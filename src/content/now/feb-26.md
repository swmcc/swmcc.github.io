*Updated monthly. This is what I was focused on in February 2026.*

## Day Job

The day job continues. Being part of a team and business that's scaling up is genuinely exciting. As a senior member, I'm leading from the front whilst formal management comes in above. It's a delicate balance of not stepping on toes whilst still making sure things get done properly. Platform building is interesting work, but I'm getting itchy for something more greenfield and unknown. That said, I'm still very happy. I love coding, and I get to do plenty of it.

I've started using Claude more heavily to enhance my workflow, and it's paying dividends with productivity. Planning mode and custom skills have fundamentally changed how I approach larger pieces of work.

## After Hours

Doing the needful for a house renovation of the hall, snug, and TV room. Picking doors, floors, and colour schemes. It's interesting enough, but honestly I just want it done. I'm sure I'll get sick of it soon. The decision fatigue is real.

The weather is pissing me off. I love the gardening, but it's been so wet that no prep can be done at all without damaging the soil. You can't dig, you can't plant, you can't even walk on the beds without compacting everything. So I'm holding and waiting for spring to spring. Can't come soon enough.

Still tracking what I watch on my [check-ins page](https://www.whatisonthe.tv/swmcc).
