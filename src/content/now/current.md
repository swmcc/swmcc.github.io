*Updated monthly. This is what I'm focused on in March 2026.*

## Day Job

Things are getting busy, which is exactly what you want. Lots of work on and it's good to be getting stuck in. The foundations of the OS system are being laid out properly now, and this month should bear fruit on all that groundwork. It's satisfying to see the architecture decisions from earlier months starting to pay off.

The team is growing, which is brilliant, but there are the inevitable pains that come with being in a scale-up. I knew this was going to happen. You can't grow without growing pains. I'm hopeful that the greenfield and unknown work is just round the corner. In the meantime, my teammates continue to inspire me to do better. Good people make hard work feel worthwhile.

## After Hours

The house renovation rumbles on. It's hard to get the right balance between making progress and doing things properly. Rush it and you'll regret it; take too long and you'll lose your mind. We've got an electrician in now and it's all moving. At the end of February I got a call saying the new furniture is in, so it should be delivered sometime early March. Had a quote from a painter, waiting on the floors being measured, new doors to sort out. It's all ongoing but I'm bored of it now. Just want it done.

The wet weather is really getting me down. Any garden prep can't happen until it stops. The roses need cut back since I left them last year, and they need done really soon before new growth kicks in. Hoping for a dry spell.

On the project side, I've been putting work into [experiments.swm.cc](https://experiments.swm.cc) and I'm now heavily working on [the-mcculloughs.org](/projects/the-mcculloughs-org). The main experiment is using local AI models to index family photos. Uploading the family pics will be an epic undertaking as they stretch from 1920 to now. You can see the work in progress on the [timeline](https://the-mcculloughs.org/timeline) (might not be public when you click, but it will be soon).

This will be my main project for March, along with a few side hustles. [Indexatron](https://experiments.swm.cc/indexatron/) is the photo indexing tool, and for a bit of fun I'll be putting info on [The Wire Graph](https://experiments.swm.cc/the-wire-graph/).

Still tracking what I watch on my [check-ins page](https://www.whatisonthe.tv/swmcc).
