## Day Job

The AI Operating System is entering an exciting phase. We're ramping up development significantly this month, shifting from foundational work to aggressive feature delivery. The big focus is third-party integrations - connecting enterprise systems, external AI providers, and compliance tooling into a unified orchestration layer. Think of it as building the nervous system that lets regulated organisations safely harness AI across their entire tech stack. The architecture decisions we made last year are paying dividends now; what would have been months of rework is instead clean integration points ready to accept new capabilities. It's the kind of work that doesn't make for flashy demos but fundamentally changes what the platform can do.

## After Hours

Started the great de-clutter in preparation for a house renovation. Turns out we've accumulated a truly impressive amount of stuff over the years. There's something cathartic about filling skip bags and rediscovering rooms. The goal is to strip things back before the builders arrive - less to move, less to damage, less to worry about.

Still very much enjoying the 100" TV. Watching films feels like having a private cinema. Currently working through some classics I never got around to seeing properly. You can see what I've been watching on my [check-ins page](https://www.whatisonthe.tv/swmcc).
