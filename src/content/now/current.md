## Day Job

Building an AI Operating System for regulated environments using FastAPI and Svelte. Currently migrating from a monolith to a distributed architecture - the classic challenge of balancing immediate complexity with long-term scalability. It's rewarding work, especially navigating the unique requirements of highly regulated industries whilst keeping the system performant and maintainable.

## Personal Projects

**Active Development:**

- **[swm.cc](https://swmcc.github.io)** - This site. Built with Astro 5, Tailwind CSS 4, and MDX. Writing technical articles and thoughts consistently.

- **[whatisonthe.tv](https://github.com/swmcc/whatisonthe.tv)** - TV and film tracking application. FastAPI backend with async PostgreSQL and Redis caching, SvelteKit frontend. Building out features for tracking series and managing watchlists.

- **[Jotter](https://github.com/swmcc/jotter)** - Self-hosted bookmark and image manager. Rails 8 with Hotwire, solving the problem of volatile third-party URLs. Own your bookmarks, own your images.

- **[the-mcculloughs.org](https://github.com/swmcc/the-mcculllughs.org)** - Family photo archive from the 1930s onwards. Rails 8 monolith, migrating from Flickr to own the data. Mobile-first design for easy family access.

**Contributing to Open Source:**

- **[tvdb-v4-python](https://github.com/thetvdb/tvdb-v4-python)** - Official Python wrapper for TheTVDB API. Added test coverage and refactoring. Project appears dormant but still functional.

## After Hours

Focusing on work-life balance: regular walks, reading fiction, being present with family.

Re-watching NYPD Blue and loving it all over again.

Preparing the garden for autumn - clearing beds, mulching, and planning for next year's growing season.
