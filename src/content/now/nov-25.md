*Updated monthly. This is what I'm focused on in November 2025.*

## Day Job

Building an AI Operating System for regulated environments using FastAPI and Svelte. Currently migrating from a monolith to a distributed architecture - the classic challenge of balancing immediate complexity with long-term scalability. It's rewarding work, especially navigating the unique requirements of highly regulated industries whilst keeping the system performant and maintainable.

## After Hours

Focusing on work-life balance: regular walks, reading fiction, being present with family.

Re-watching NYPD Blue and loving it all over again.

Preparing the garden for autumn - clearing beds, mulching, and planning for next year's growing season.

Building this website and writing more consistently.
