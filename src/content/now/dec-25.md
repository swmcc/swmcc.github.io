*Updated monthly. This is what I'm focused on in December 2025.*

## Day Job

Still building the AI Operating System for regulated environments. This month has been about integrating Gemini into the workflow - exploring how it fits alongside our existing tooling and where it can genuinely add value versus being a shiny distraction. The usual balance of shipping features whilst keeping the architecture clean. Winding down towards the Christmas break and trying to get everything stable before the holidays.

## After Hours

Re-watching [For All Mankind](https://www.whatisonthe.tv/show/356202) and absolutely loving it. You can see what else I've been watching on my [check-ins page](https://www.whatisonthe.tv/swmcc).

Working on a new personal project: [agentic.nvim](https://github.com/swmcc/agentic.nvim). Hoping to properly get stuck into it over the Christmas break when I've got some uninterrupted time.

Oh, and I bought a 100" TV. Completely ridiculous, but life's too short.
