  - title: "Star Wars: Master of Evil"
    author: "Adam Christopher"
    genre: "Science Fiction"
    finishedDate: "2025-12-21"
    blurb: "It works best when it focuses on the aftermath rather than the action. It’s a story about power, obsession and the cost of thinking you can control everything once you’ve crossed the line. The dark side feels less like spectacle and more like a slow, narrowing trap, which makes it quietly unsettling in a way a lot of Star Wars books avoid."

  - title: "The Bonfire of the Vanities"
    author: "Tom Wolfe"
    genre: "Fiction"
    blurb: "I liked this as a sharp, unsparing satire of 80s wealth, power and status anxiety. It captures how fragile success really is when it’s built on money, reputation and being seen to belong, and how quickly that world turns once scrutiny arrives. It’s funny, cruel, and deeply uncomfortable in places, which is exactly why it works."

    author: "Isaac Asimov"
    genre: "Science Fiction"
    blurb: "I loved the Apple TV show and picked this up because of it. The book is different in places but still very cool, and it adds depth and texture that the screen version only hints at. It’s sharp, tense and very easy to get pulled into 📘📺🔥"

    genre: "Science Fiction"
    blurb: "I didn’t like this. I wanted a tighter, punchier Mace Windu story, but it felt like it took too long to get moving and the vibe never quite clicked for me. There are cool ideas in it, but I kept feeling like I was pushing through instead of getting pulled along."

    blurb: "I liked the insights this book gave into how decisions and narratives shaped the 2024 election and leadership challenges. It doesn’t read like cheerleading or criticism from one side or the other but offers detailed reporting and perspective on how people close to the presidency made choices and coped with pressure."

    blurb: "I loved the film. It was one of the first I saw at a cinema with my brother back in 1993 when I was 14 on holiday in the Isle of Man. There weren’t many cinemas in pre Good Friday Agreement Northern Ireland for teenagers, so it felt like a real treat. The book goes deeper on the detail and is different in parts, which I really enjoyed."
