		<h2>swm.cc <small>this site</small></h2>
		
		<p>I have never really had a homepage before so this really was a blank canvas. I am no good at designing or graphics, CSS holds little interest for me (I will do it if I have to though). So instead of spending time designing a site and playing with CSS I decided to use <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter bootstrap</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The reason for never having a homepage (before it was straight onto a blog or a holderpage for google+ or about.me) was mainly due to never really having a good idea for one. Other than the standard "this is me" pages I never seen one that grabbed me. Then I came across <a href="http://tomg.co/">Tom Gallacher</a> and his site inspired me to make a terminal based site. It wouldn't be too hard - with some javascript, css and a bit of graft it would be possible. Obviously I didn't want to copy him verbatim as I would learn nothing. So I opened up sublime and started to 'hack at it'.</p>
		
		<p>Tom's site is written in node.js and uses the excellent <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> framework. I have written a few 'apps' in it (to be released soon) but decided against for this site. Instead I opted to write my terminal using <a href="http://mootools.net/">mootools</a> and just hand crafted JS instead of being smart like Tom did.</p>
		
		<p>The terminal section is just a bit of fun and rather apt for me as I love the terminal. As a programmer I spend a bit of time in it. I don't expect it to get used much. The terminal is written using <a href="http://mootools.net/" target="_new">mootools</a>.</p>
		
		<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_new">jekyll</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/grunt" target="_new">grunt</a>, <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_new">HTML5Boilerplate</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_new">jQuery</a>.</p>

		<p>Also to keep <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/adriandugan" target="_new">Duggie</a> happy it is also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design">responsive</a>.</p>

		<p>I move between hosting this on my own server and on <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>. I don't know why I just do.</p>

		<h2>TVListings.app <small>tv listings parser</small></h2>
		
		<p>This is mainly a legacy project. Back in 2002 I got Sky in but found their planner to be pretty much useless. It never told me when things were on and I don't even think they had a series link back then. So instead of trawling through the radio times and the like I decided to write my own. I used the data provided by the <a href="http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/Main_Page">XMLTV.org</a> people and parse the information on a semily regular basis. This way I could then do what I wanted with the data.</p>
		
		<p>I created various things with it - an email reminder to email me of when my shows would be on or coming up. A watchlist so I could keep an eye when a certain star was going to appear on tv as a guest or a recurring character. I then extended it to take episode information - with the grand idea that I could use something to say "show me all the episodes from the X-Files that include the cigaratte smoking man". I was partially successful. However as it was a one man band project I couldn't keep up with the advent of sky+, tivo and other sites.</p>
		
		<p>I gave it a major re-write in 2005 and used <a href="https://github.com/mirod/xmltwig">XML::Twig</a>. It still uses Class::DBI for its db interface (MySQL) - it should be re-written to use DBIx::Class as it is still supported. it still works. I don't really have a use case for it now as I either use 'On Demand' or 'Sky+' now to catch what I want to watch. So every three days a cron runs to collect the information and put it into a database. At the time of writing I have every tv listings/star information from the start of 2011 until now (April 2013). It might come in useful some time.</p>

		<p>I added in a lucene index to the build. Mainly for proof of concept. I could have easily do this in Perl/Ruby/PHP but opted for groovy for a challenge.</p>

		<p>I just use it now to test a data set with something new - JSON parsing etc.</p>

		<h2>themcculloughs.org <small>on-going/stalled</small></h2>
		
		<p>For a christmas gift I took the 35mm slides that my parents had and digitised them. The plan was to create an application that sat on top of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> and took the photos from there and depending on who was viewing them it would render out a different name who was tagged in the photo. For example any of my Father would be tagged as 'Dad'. However if it was my cousin it would be 'Uncle Ed', same thing with my 'Uncle Sam', to my cousin he would be 'Dad' but to cousins son he would be 'Grandad' and to my Mum he would be 'Sam'.</p>
		<p>This project has stalled. I might go back to it at some stage though as I think it was quite a nice thing to do.</p>
		<p>No technology was used for this as it never really got off the ground. I am keeping it under my projects in the vain attempt that maybe it will shame me into doing it.</p>

		<p><em>Giants are made by standing on the shoulders of drawves...lots of them</em>.<br /> This is a talk I gave to a user group in London in May 2013. I was over that day anyway and so I went and gave this lightning talk.</p>

		<p>The basic elements of this talk are that good systems and developers can be built on using lots of small 'apps' or 'processes'. As a lightning talk there isn't much substance to it - but there was a good Q&A session after.</p>
