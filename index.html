		<p>I have never really had a homepage before so this really was a blank canvas. I am no good at designing or graphics, CSS holds little interest for me (I will do it if I have to though). So instead of spending time designing a site and playing with CSS I decided to use <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter bootstrap</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The reason for never having a homepage (before it was straight onto a blog or a holderpage for google+ or about.me) was mainly due to never really having a good idea for one. Other than the standard "this is me" pages I never seen one that grabbed me. Then I came across <a href="http://tomg.co/">Tom Gallacher</a> and his site inspired me to make a terminal based site. It wouldn't be too hard - with some javascript, css and a bit of graft it would be possible. Obviously I didn't want to copy him verbatim as I would learn nothing. So I opened up sublime and started to 'hack at it'.</p>
		
		<p>Tom's site is written in node.js and uses the excellent <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> framework. I have written a few 'apps' in it (to be released soon) but decided against for this site. Instead I opted to write my terminal using <a href="http://mootools.net/">mootools</a> and just hand crafted JS instead of being smart like Tom did.</p>
		
		<p>The terminal section is just a bit of fun and rather apt for me as I love the terminal. As a programmer I spend a bit of time in it. I don't expect it to get used much. The terminal is written using <a href="http://mootools.net/" target="_new">mootools</a>.</p>
		
		<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_new">jekyll</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/grunt" target="_new">grunt</a>, <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_new">HTML5Boilerplate</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_new">jQuery</a>.</p>

		<p>Also to keep <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/adriandugan" target="_new">Duggie</a> happy it is also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design">responsive</a>.</p>

		<h2>TVListings.app <small>tv listings parser</small></h2>
		
		<p>This is mainly a legacy project. Back in 2002 I got Sky in but found their planner to be pretty much useless. It never told me when things were on and I don't even think they had a series link back then. So instead of trawling through the radio times and the like I decided to write my own. I used the data provided by the <a href="http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/Main_Page">XMLTV.org</a> people and parse the information on a semily regular basis. This way I could then do what I wanted with the data.</p>
		
		<p>I created various things with it - an email reminder to email me of when my shows would be on or coming up. A watchlist so I could keep an eye when a certain star was going to appear on tv as a guest or a recurring character. I then extended it to take episode information - with the grand idea that I could use something to say "show me all the episodes from the X-Files that include the cigaratte smoking man". I was partially successful. However as it was a one man band project I couldn't keep up with the advent of sky+, tivo and other sites.</p>
		
		<p>I gave it a major re-write in 2005 and used <a href="https://github.com/mirod/xmltwig">XML::Twig</a>. It still uses Class::DBI for its db interface (MySQL) - it should be re-written to use DBIx::Class as it is still supported. it still works. I don't really have a use case for it now as I either use 'On Demand' or 'Sky+' now to catch what I want to watch. So every three days a cron runs to collect the information and put it into a database. At the time of writing I have every tv listings/star information from the start of 2011 until now (May 2012). It might come in useful some time.</p>

		<p>I just use it now to test a data set with something new - JSON parsing etc.</p>
