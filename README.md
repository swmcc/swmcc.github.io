This is the source to my personal site - http://swm.cc

The site is in two parts:

	-  a 'terminal' emulator written in javascipt with basic functionality.

	-  a 'gui'

terminal
========

The terminal emulates a BASH enviroment. Here are a list of commands:

blog		link to my blog.	
clear		clear the creen.
cd		change Directroy.
contact		contact info.
cv		displays a compact cv.
exit		exit the session.
git		link to my github address.
goto		jump to other sites (blog delicious linkedin githb).
help		displays this list.
linkedin	link to LinkedIn profile.
ls		list directories.
projects	list of projects.
skills		list of professional skills.
startx		start the GUI version of this website.
wget		download files to your desktop.
whois		whoami?

gui
===

An extra layer that goes into more detail than you can get from the 'terminal'.

This is heavily inspired by Tom Gallacher (tomg.co).
